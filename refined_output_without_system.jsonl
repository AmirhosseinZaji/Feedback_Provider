The decentralized, secure, and transparent nature of a blockchain opens doors to so many possible applications in this regard. Allowing real-time tracking of goods, automating contractual agreements through smart contracts, and making the transactions authentic, thereby overcoming some traditional SCM system inefficiencies. Specifically, it enables heightened supply chain visibility for better traceability, which is highly necessary in industries dealing with perishable products, counterfeit risks, or regulatory compliances. It cuts down on intermediaries because all stakeholders access the same set of records, which are previously validated and tamper-proof; this drives cost economy and speeds up processes.\\n\\n \\n\\nExecutive Summary:\\nDespite these benefits, several major barriers impede blockchain's widespread adoption in SCM. Issues to be given attention are huge costs related to initial network setup, the need to integrate with available systems, and the complexity of standardization of data across different organizations (Andreyev et al., 2018). Some other important technical issues are still not fixed now and have to do with scalability and energy consumption, when global supply chains have to feel a large number of transactions involved (Weber et al., 2017). Furthermore, it is faced with regulatory uncertainties and the absence of qualified personnel who could handle the blockchain technique. Apart from that, there is a kind of skepticism regarding blockchain maturity and potential, partly because of its connection with cryptocurrencies, which adds to the reason for hesitancy on the part of business house adoptions. Thus, in as much as blockchain holds a lot of promising efficiency and transparency for supply chains, it would require overcoming these challenges for successful and widespread implementation in SCM.\\n\\n\\nApplications of blockchain in supply chain management:\\n\\nThe key applications in the use of Blockchain in supply chain management include real-time tracking, where firms track down the goods' mobility along the value chain. Each step-from manufacturing to delivery-is recorded in a decentralized ledger, creating a transparent and immutable record of the product's journey with blockchain. This feature proves most beneficial in industries such as pharmaceuticals and food, where traceability is indispensable to make sure their products are safe and also meet the relevant set regulations. Another notable area of application lies in smart contracts-a specific kind of self-executing contract whereby the rules of the agreement between parties are directly written into code. Smart contracts will automatically apply those rules and the resulting fines upon some infringement, guaranteeing speedy and efficient transaction processing with minimal involvement by third-party operators. It can also find its place in supply chain quality management systems. For instance, blockchain enables great coordination between suppliers and producers in ensuring greater precision in the management of inventory. As Andreyev et al. (2018) have argued, blockchain will help to decrease the level of fraud and fake products since it securely keeps transaction data in decentralized records. This holds great relevance to industries such as luxury goods and electronics, whereby counterfeiting of products has been considered a major problem in recent times (Chen et al., 2017).\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nChallenges in Blockchain Adoption within Supply Chain Management:\\n\\nDespite such potential, however, it remains that a number of substantial barriers exist to the widespread adoption of blockchain for supply chain management. Probably one of the most clear-cut is the cost of investment required to implement a blockchain solution. This, particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises, can be prohibitively high: the initial investment required in blockchain infrastructure, and its integration into existing supply chain systems, often renders the proposition too costly for many firms to entertain. It also requires interoperability across organizations and industries with standardization, which is indeed a very difficult process to handle with regulatory coordination at the global level. According to Weber et al. (2017), scalability is another major challenge. While blockchain works effectively in a smaller number of networks, its performance may decline by increasing the number of participants. Global supply chains that could need to process thousands of transactions per second may be in for serious delays due to blockchain technology's inherently limiting nature. In addition, the use of high energy-most proof-of-work systems do-blockchain is considered an environmental and cost concern, thus making its implementation more difficult in supply chain management. Other complications involve regulatory uncertainty and a general lack of qualified professionals well-versed in blockchain technology. Most countries have yet to set clear legal or jurisdictional guidelines on the implementation of blockchain technology, which makes businesses very wary. There is also a shortage of expertise in manpower necessary for its implementation and management, which may delay efforts towards its adoption.\\n\\n \\n\\nConclusion:\\nThe potential of blockchain technology provides immense opportunities to bring in betterment in supply chain management with increased transparency, security, and efficiency. Its applications, like real-time tracking, smart contracts, and decentralized quality management, solve many of the inefficiencies persisting in the systems of supply chains. Thus, blockchain, while supplementing added benefits like better traceability, cost reduction, and building greater trust among the participants within the supply chain, will become one of the most promising solutions for such industries faced with complex global logistics. The reverse would be that the barriers exist aplenty in the path of increased adoption; these include a high cost of implementation, scalability issues, and fuzzy regulations. The full harnessing of this technology to supply chain management will continue to demand further technological development and standardization, and even cooperation across governments and industries. In time, as blockchain continues to mature, such integration into global supply chains could become increasingly viable and would change, in essence, the nature of supply chains across the globe.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nReferences:\\nAndreyev, R.

Indeed it is not only confined to cryptocurrency since it can cause its effect in different areas including the healthcare sector. As for the utilization of blockchain technology in healthcare, it is claimed that it will revolutionize how patient records will be shared because of the transparency, privacy and security concerns of the shared record. The following essay is devoted to describing the chances, benefits, and failures of the blockchain in the sphere of healthcare.\\n\\nApplications of Blockchain in Healthcare\\n\\nHealthcare applications, especially those surrounding blockchain usage in the storage of electronic health records, have been growing. Blockchain will solve issues related to traditional EHR storage systems' fragmentation and their propensity to get hacked. Using this technology, blockchain will allow every authorized health professional to access any patient record anywhere instantly, adding efficiency but making due considerations towards ensuring that there is a layer of protection over a patient's privacy. Also, the blockchain treats drug distribution by tracing every stage in the chain of supply for authentication to handle drugs properly. This in turn creates accountability, traceability, and trust among the stakeholders.\\n\\nBenefits of Blockchain in Healthcare\\n\\nThe first proposed advantage of blockchain in the healthcare industry is security improvement. Since medical data is highly sensitive the feature to encrypt the patient data to prevent any unauthorized access or interference is essential. This makes it difficult for any one party to gain control of the information on the blockchain hence making it hard for hackers to breach it (Ekblaw et al., 2016). Every transaction has a hash of the previous transaction, and is incredibly difficult for someone to modify the information.\\n\\nMoreover, through blockchain, integration between other healthcare entities, departments, and networks is promoted. Because the patient record is maintained on a shared electronic medical record network, the healthcare provider does not need to refer to separate systems to find information. This saves time which could otherwise have been spent waiting for the results from a laboratory or from another healthcare professional who may have evaluated the client. In addition, patients have improved ownership of their health data and therefore they can grant or withdraw consent on their data as they please.\\n\\nObstacles to Blockchain Adoption in Healthcare\\n\\n            However, there are circumstances in which blockchain in health situations is very limited. It has, however, been to the downside that the technology is not advanced enough to support large-scale operations. Blockchain systems are highly computation-intensive, and the increase in the number of transactions, adds to the load on the system. This could lead to slow operations and become costly hence not being largely adopted into large health care organizations.\\n\\nAnother challenge is the regulatory and standards requirements set up by an organization. The health sector itself is very sensitive and regulated; it includes even the HIPAA in the United States. Blockchain, then, must meet such legal requirements of privacy while still keeping the core architecture that is, basically, decentralized yet transparent. Moreover, the implementation of blockchains in healthcare may be quite difficult with the structure as it is now, needing huge capital investments in infrastructures and personnel.\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nThe blockchain is vital in the revolution of the healthcare system through improving security, attaining unity across the networks, and ensuring the validity of drugs across the chain. There are, however, problems like scale and compliance issues that need to be dealt with for the adoption of blockchains in healthcare systems. Since technologies are developing, it was expected that blockchain would be a considerable part of healthcare development in the future, which means it can reveal increased effectiveness compared to the current system, focusing on the patients.\\n\\nReferences:\\n\\nAzaria, A.

Trader Joe's Inbounds many of items directly, which maintains quality and lowers prices by eliminating the middleman (Billington & Nie, 2009).\\n\\nOperations\\n\\nStore operations: Trader Joe's has a few numbers of SKUs (approximately 4,000, compared to the corporate average of 30,000-50,000 SKUs) (Grewal, Krishnan, Levy, & Munger, 2010). This simplified option allows for efficient inventory turnover and reduces operational complexity.\\n\\nFocus on in-store enjoyment: The company emphasizes a completely unique in-store experience, a well-designed layout and a welcoming ecosystem.\\n\\nOutbound Logistics\\nDistribution efficiency: Trader Joe's uses centralization to ship goods from suppliers to its stores. This model ensures that goods are always available and clean.\\n\\nInventory management: Simplifying SKUs helps streamline inventory operations, thereby reducing issues of out-of-stock and overstock.\\n\\nMarketing & Sales\\nTrader Joe's relies mostly on word of mouth rather than traditional marketing; Trader Joe's does not offer discounts or loyalty programs, but instead, it features reduced day-to-day costs. This strategy reinforces its commitment to offering customers prices rather than the gimmicks typically used by retail businesses.\\n\\nServices\\nCustomer service: The company's employees are friendly, helpful and dedicated to customers from the heart. Create a positive shopping experience.\\n\\nCompany\u2019s Infrastructure\\nOrganized form: Trader Joe's is loosely organized, and managers have a lot of autonomy to follow the conditions of nearby markets. This flexibility can maintain constant brand value, even if the store is allowed to meet the precise needs of the community (Ebster & Khalil, n.d.).\\n\\nHuman Resource Management\\n\\nEmployee Education: Trader Joe's is known for its employee-friendly rules and regulations, competitive salaries, advantages, and possibilities for growth. Companies train their employees to be happy, helpful and engaged.\\n\\nTechnology Development\\nWhile Trader Joe's has a traditional way of doing business, it has begun to adopt additional technology, especially in areas such as inventory management and customer support, to boost performance and improve the shopping experience.\\n\\nTrader Joe's sourcing techniques emphasize sustainability and ethics, ensuring that products meet the company's over-satisfaction standards and social obligations (Kim, Lim, Reilly, & Williamson, 2011).\\n\\nBehavior Analysis Technology\\n\\nTrader Joe's wants its employees to work in a relaxed environment. However, sometimes the safety operation of production is very serious, and our team wants to introduce behavior analysis technology to protect the production safety of employees. Behavioral Analysis The impact of video surveillance on Trader Joe's value chain. The decision to implement video surveillance technology along the Trader Joe's value chain, to optimize workplace protection (Cristani, Raghavendra, Del Bue, & Murino, 2013).\\n\\n\\n\\nHuman Resource Management\\n\\nEnhanced safety and compliance: Trader Joe's takes the personal safety of its employees very seriously (Sinha, Subramanian, Bhattacharya, & Chaudhary, 2012). Video can detect dangerous behavior in real time, correct actions on the spot, and conduct thorough incident analysis.\\n\\nOperations\\n\\nBy reducing production accidents, Trader Joe's can maintain a stable workforce, and fewer injuries mean less downtime, less medical expenses, and less legal liability, all of which contribute to cost savings.\\n\\nTechnology Development\\nBehavioral analysis video provides valuable facts that can be used to enhance conservation education programs. Instead of relying entirely on theoretical guidance, Trader Joe's can use real-life lenses to illustrate best practices and safety incidents, making education more effective and engaging for employees (Cristani et al., 2013).\\n\\nCompany\u2019s Infrastructure\\nThe initial funding for video includes costs for cameras, storage, and integration with existing structures.\\n\\nAdditional Margin on The Project\\n\\nInstalling video equipment in all stores and warehouses may be expensive. A Behavior analysis camera can value anywhere from $500 to $1,500.\\n\\nIf video surveillance can lessen work-associated accidents via 10%, it is able to keep a lot of money. For example, if Trader Joe's spends $10 million a year on work-related accidents and related prices, a 10% reduction should probably keep $1 million.\\n\\nBy reducing accidents and strengthening employee safety, employees may have additional productivity, ensuing in a predicted 2-3% increase in productivity. For a commercial enterprise with $16.5 billion in sales (Eich & Eich, 2024), even a 2% boom in productivity can generate $33 million in sales.\\n\\nConsidering the costs of implementation and Increased productiveness, the ROI of Behavior analysis camera may be enormous. If the whole implementation prices $10 million and the projected annual savings in productivity earnings are $34 million, the return on money will be well.\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nReferences\\n\\nBillington, C., & Nie, W.

It has been characterized by its unique operational efficiency and customer satisfaction. The in-store experience, well thought out products and great service keep that business enormously popular with customers. There are many challenges they have to face regarding managing the e-commerce platform, other digital marketing, real time customer service to remain competitive in the market. As consumers continue to adopt new change and digital transformation so Trader Joe\u2019s should do the same. There are some major segmentations of Potter\u2019s value chain; inbound logistics, operations, marketing, integrate more sophisticated technologies, after sales service, etc. This research essay will suggest adopting e-commerce solutions, digital marketing strategies, Ai-driven customer support and feedback to fix existing gaps and provide quick wins. Through the integration of secure payment system, online advertising based on target market & new customer service will Trader Joe\u2019s be better positioned in the market demand. This will significantly improve the existing operational efficiency and customer feedbacks through interaction for long term success.\\n\\nTrader Joe\u2019s Company Value Chain\\n\\nTrader Joe\u2019s current value chain is divided into two major parts: primary and support activities. Primary activity includes inbound logistics, operations, outbound logistics, marketing/sales, and after-sales service. Support activity includes company infrastructure, human resources, technology department, and procurement. \\n\\nPrimary Activities\\n\\n Trader Joe\u2019s inbound logistics involves sourcing products from suppliers, maintaining supplier relations, product inventory, and replenishment. Efficient store layout and providing a positive customer experience is a part of its operational activity. A centralized distribution model, product distribution to stores, and inventory management are the key activities that fall under outbound logistics. Trader Joe's has a unique marketing technique, word-of-mouth, and a customer-centric approach that differentiates them from competitors (Burke, 2024). Customer-centric return policy and support are their forte, and they help them retain customers.\\n\\nSupport Activities\\n\\nTrader Joe's has a solid organizational culture and brand identity that differentiates it from its competitors. It follows a decentralized decision-making process, which speeds up work. Competitive wages/salaries, benefits, and career growth reduce employee turnover and dissatisfaction. The company also provides employees with developmental support to make them more engaged and focused, as it believes a happy employee means a happy customer (Burke, 2024). Trader Joe's uses solutions to optimize inventory and store operations. The tracking system in POS machines fetches customer buying patterns used as targeted marketing. Procurement is about supplier relations, sustainable and ethical sourcing, and adhering to labor, product, and environmental laws. \\n\\nFigure 1\\n\\nA diagram of a companyDescription automatically generatedTrader Joe\u2019s Value Chain\\n\\nNote. The author developed Trader Joe\u2019s current value chain based on research.\\n\\nBusiness Gaps in Trader Joe\u2019s\\n\\nE-commerce/ordering service/delivery service.\\nOnline/social media marketing.\\nReal-time online customer service.\\nProposed Application of Technology to Trader Joe\u2019s Value Chain\\n\\nOutbound Logistics\\n\\nCreating a secure payment e-commerce platform on its website with an online ordering service can attract more customers and increase sales for Trader Joe\u2019s. (stripe.com, 2023). Although the company does not run a delivery service, it can partner with Uber Eats to deliver online orders to customers. (Tardi, 2024).\\n\\nMarketing/Sales\\n\\nTrader Joe\u2019s does not do \u201ctraditional marketing\u201d. (Tardi, 2024). However, it can reach a wider audience through digital marketing campaigns where customers take their favorite Trader Joe\u2019s in-store images and experiences to post on their respective social/new media handles. Customers can be incentivized to engage in the promotion, and AI algorithms can be deployed to monitor the efficacy of the promotion.\\n\\nService\\n\\nAI assistants can be deployed on the e-commerce platform to create an excellent customer service experience.\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nProposed new diagram\\n\\nA screenshot of a computerDescription automatically generated\\n\\nThe reason behind choosing the new value chain\\n\\nIntegrating e-commerce, online marketing, and real-time customer service into Trader Joe's value chain closes significant business gaps and aligns the company with shifting consumer preferences. In this respect, a secure e-commerce platform can be integrated for online order placement to increase the convenience of customers and expand its base, both extremely crucial steps in today's digital landscape. This is certainly offset by partnering with delivery services like Uber Eats so that customers can get their favorite products without a visit to the store. Also, with AI-driven social media marketing, brand visibility and customer engagement are hugely maximized to keep up in today's competitive market. Finally, AI assistants implemented within the e-commerce platform improve customer service to ensure a smooth shopping experience that might influence customer loyalty and retention. These strategic applications of technology drive not just modernization at Trader Joe's; they also better place it in line to grab new market opportunities.\\n\\n \\n\\nCalculation\\n\\nMargin= (Total value created by a company's activities-Cost of performing the activities)\\nIncreased sales generated from the secured payment e-commerce site & app - the cost of building the app/site = margin.\\nThe sales revenue generated from increased market share - the cost of AI algorithms and incentives given to customers to run the digital campaign = margin.\\nThe value derived from customer retention online - the cost of online AI assistants = margin.\\nEstimated Calculations\\n\\n Increased Sales Value from e-commerce\\nProjected increased sales: $30 million per year (Assumptions)\\n\\nPlatform building and maintenance cost: $5 million.\\n\\nMargin = (increased Sales - Platform Building cost)\\n\\nMargin=$30 million-$5 million=$25 million\\n\\nIncreased sales return value from Digital Marketing\\nProjected increase in sales: $15 million per annum.\\n\\nThe cost of AI algorithms and incentives: $2 million\\n\\nMargin=$15 million\u2212$2 million=$13 million\\n\\nE-Commerce Platform:\\nEstimated Increased Revenue from Retained Customers: $10 million annually due to improved customer service.\\n\\nCost of Implementing AI Assistants: $3 million.\\n\\nMargin=Increased Revenue from Retained Customers\u2212Cost of AI Assistants\\n\\nMargin=$10 million\u2212$3 million=$7 million\\n\\n                                                      Conclusion\\n        After the margin is calculated, the new proposed value chain seems to have a significant impact with a differentiated positioning in the market for Trader Joe\u2019s. It contributed the operational success and better consumer feedback than before. Still the company needs to fill up some possible gaps regarding e-commerce, digital marketing, real time customer support to remain competitive to grow in the business. Improvement of technologies can help this company to adopt new proposed value chain  with an addition to secure e-commerce system, Ai- driven digital marketing initiatives and simultaneous consumer feedback to the system. All these will fix existing gaps and will create quick wins. It will also smoothen the operation process with higher customer satisfaction. All the strategic investments have already seen to increase in sales and customer loyalty. The digital transformation of Trader Joe\u2019s will resolve existing problems and become a competitive body in the market with the new proposed value chain.\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nBurke, L.

Known for offering high-end, non-promotional items at low prices and with reduced use of coupons or membership, Trader Joe\u2019s sustains the sale of private brands. To overcome existing business deficiencies, the Technological department has suggested expanding its use of information technologies to improve its operations and, accordingly, the worth of its value chain. \\n\\nCurrent Porter\u2019s Value Chain model: \\n\\nSuppliers enable negotiation for reduced prices for unique products while using just-in-time inventory techniques to maintain product freshness and reduce the need for large warehouses (Shaw, A. A., 2024). They cooperate with different manufacturing companies to expand product choices reduce costs and utilize a centralized distribution model for efficient delivery and inventory circulation. Furthermore, they focus on in-store sales through various marketing campaigns and prioritize outstanding customer service (Shaw, A. A., 2024). Trader Joe's also employs a highly decentralized support model for store managers, emphasizes employee development, and invests in innovative retail technologies. Additionally, the company maintains a meticulous approach to selecting reliable vendors. \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nBusiness Gaps & Proposed State-of-the-Art Technologies With it\u2019s Reasons: \\n\\nTransparency in Supply Chain: \\n\\nThe supply chain needs to be more efficient. \\n\\nImplement the blockchain technologies. \\n\\nReason: Provides a secure, transparent ledger, enhancing product authenticity and ethical sourcing, which boosts customer trust. \\n\\nOptimization of Inventory Management: \\n\\nDemand forecasting and inventory management should be strengthened to cut down on waste and reduce shortages \\n\\nMachine Learning Algorithms and AI. \\n\\nReason: Improves demand forecasting and reduces waste, enhancing operational efficiency.  \\n\\nPersonalized Customer Experience: \\n\\nLack of personalized customer interactions. \\n\\nImplementing Customer Relationship Management (CRM) with the help of AI. \\n\\nReason: Enhances customer experience through personalized recommendations and services, driving satisfaction and retention (What Is CRM? | a Definition by Salesforce, n.d.). \\n\\nTraining and Development Program for Employees: \\n\\nThe need for employee training to adapt proposed innovations is crucial. \\n\\nDesign new training programs with the help of technologies like Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality. \\n\\nReason: Provides immersive training, improving employee performance and reducing turnover. \\n\\nOnline Presence: \\n\\nLimited online presence. \\n\\nA user-friendly website and mobile applications can be introduced in the initial stages. \\n\\nReason: Will expand digital presence, tapping into e-commerce to reach more customers and increase sales. \\n\\nNew Porter\u2019s Value Chain Model: \\n\\n \\n\\nEstimated suggested technologies added margin to the company's value chain: \\n\\n \\n\\n(Source: by author)\\n\\nConclusion: \\n\\nImplementing and monitoring state-of-the-art technologies can improve the rating of the company\u2019s operation, employees\u2019 output, customer satisfaction, and sales.

Through the analysis of Trader Joe's value chain, this paper seeks the current business gap, aiming to promote the continuous improvement of the company's profits by tapping more advanced technology.\\n\\nCurrent value chain of Trader Joe\u2019s\\nIn terms of Primary Activities, for Inbound Logistics, Trader Joe's has a simple and efficient supply chain. For example, it bypasses middlemen, orders products directly from suppliers, and sells products through its store network. At the same time, Trader Joe's will place large orders in advance, giving suppliers enough time for processing and distribution (Kim et al.,2011). In operations management, fast inventory turnover while having industry-leading sales per square foot. In terms of marketing, Trader Joe's personalized the store decoration, created a fun and friendly shopping environment, and created a shopping experience of customer interest, so that customers are keen to visit the store, but also satisfied with the product consumption experience (Billington & Nie, 2009). On Outbound Logistics, Trader Joe's adopts a centralized distribution model that not only reduces costs and increases efficiency, but also enhances flexibility and increases customer satisfaction (Magee, 2021). In terms of service, Trader Joe's strives to recruit cheerful, outgoing employees to align them with the corporate culture. All employees will receive in-depth training to ensure that they can satisfy and delight customers (Yaffe-Bellany, 2020).\\n\\nIn terms of Support activity, Trader Joe's stores follow a highly decentralized principle, empowering store managers to use local materials and local art elements as much as possible. In addition, 80% of the products in the store are private brands, and vigorously develop star products to avoid vicious competition with other brands in the market. Trader Joe's also maintains a competitive advantage in employee benefits, such as medical insurance and pension plans, and the purchase of its products at discounted prices (Magee, 2021).\\n\\n\\n\\nThe optimized value chain of Trader Joe\u2019s\\nIn terms of Primary Activities, for Inbound Logistics, the current inventory management lacks real-time tracking and forecasting functions. It is suggested to adopt AI-driven supplier relationship management (SRM) systems to complete automatic replenishment according to demand and inventory to reduce waste and cost and added margin= 5-1.5= $3.5 (Grant., 2024). For operations, Robotics for stocking shelves can be used to help employees replenish shelves and improve work efficiency and added margin=6-4=$ 2 million (Tanaka et al., 2022). For outbound logistics, the distribution cost can be reduced by adopting advanced fleet management systems and planning routes with the lowest cost and added margin=3-1.3= $ 1.7 million (Efstathiadis & Silkoglou, 2015). For Marketing & Sales, AR technology can be provided online to enable customers to better understand products at home and increase their purchase intention and added margin=6-2.5=$ 3.5 million (Carmigniani et al., 2011). For Service, VR technology is used to conduct simulated scene training for employees, and customer satisfaction is improved by improving the response speed and professionalism of employees to the different needs of customers. and added margin=4-2= $ 2 million (Burdea & Coiffet, 2003).\\n\\nIn terms of Support Activities, for Human Resource Management, AI technology can be used to design a process suitable for enterprise recruitment and increase the possibility of recruiting suitable talents and added margin= 2.5-1=$ 1.5 million (Allal-Ch\u00e9rif et al., 2021).\\n\\n            \\n\\nConclusion\\nIn total, the introduction of advanced technology is expected to add $14.2million in profits to the business, enabling Trader Joe's to succeed in a highly competitive market.\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nReferences\\nAllal-Ch\u00e9rif, O., Ar\u00e1nega, A.

The suggested changes are enhancement of the inbound and outbound logistics, the usage of blockchain technology regarding the product check for authenticity, customer data analysis for formalized marketing procedures, and individual check-out workstations.\\n\\nBackground\\n\\nCurrently, a chain of grocery stores across the United States known as Trader Joe\u2019s has 563 stores operating in 43 states and was initially established in 1958 as Pronto Markets. It involves selling selected products at affordable prices whereby the services provided offer a variety of wines, frozen as well as prepared meals, and groceries (Trader Joes.com, 2024).\\n\\nCurrent Porter\u2019s Value Chain\\n\\nPrimary activities \u2013 the buying of products is at the next level, for instance, Trader Joe's Shop which is a Grocery chain shop. Their operations include quality control through a tasting compartment, and the final products are available in e-businesses and supermarkets. Its marketing strategy gives high-quality, low-priced goods without using coupons or loyalty cards, which are frequently used by rival stores. Concerning their core customers, they aim to feature an entertaining and fulfilling in-store retail experience (Trader Joe 's.com, 2024).\\n\\nThese support activities consist of the effective administrative department that undertakes follow-ups with customers and suppliers for their feedback or new vendor information. Human resources stress cordial staff to enhance customer satisfaction (Magee, 2021). The IT department plays a minor role in providing an easy-to-use online shopping platform and website, whereas the procurement aims to purchase goods in large quantities to achieve price discounts (Jones, et. al., 2019).\\n\\n\\n\\n(Source: By Author)\\n\\n Proposed State of Art Technologies\\n\\nLogistics Optimization Software\\n\\nLogistics optimization can thus be defined as the magnification and improvement of effective and efficient ways of managing the supply chain to cut costs, shorten the time taken in the process, and increase levels of satisfaction among customers (Inbound logistics.com, 2024).\\n\\nReasons for Choosing Logistics Optimization Software:\\n\\nShipment tracking and monitoring help Trader Joe\u2019s identify and resolve any shipment issues on time.\\nEnhances distribution possibilities about the reduction of unserved transportation capacity or wasted time for the trucks and drivers (Inbound logistics.com, 2024).\\nSaves money by avoiding costly stockouts and helps to manage stocks more effectively.\\nMobile App and Personalization Implementation\\n\\nWhen developing an application for the Trader Joe\u2019s store, it is possible to incorporate the digital shopping list, barcode scanner, store locator, and special deals (Jones, et. al., 2019).

AI and ML stand at the center of this digital change, offering better solutions in operations, results, and worth (Loh, 2024). This report will, therefore, seek to establish and discuss the role artificial intelligence and machine learning play in the manufacturing industry.\\n\\nCritical Applications of AI and ML in Manufacturing\\n\\nPredictive Maintenance\\n\\n The most promising area of implementing AI in manufacturing is predictive maintenance. Machine history data can be fed into AI algorithms to identify if specific equipment is likely to fail shortly (HSO, n.d.). This allows for early detection and maintenance, thus reducing time spent and expensive repairs.\\n\\nQuality Control\\n\\nInnovative vision systems that include high-resolution and high-definition cameras can more precisely detect product defects (Metrology News, 2023). It is advantageous since it can locate defects that are usually difficult to see by the human eye, particularly when inspecting the final products during manufacturing (Hryniewicz,2024).\\n\\nProcess Optimization\\n\\nThrough the data gathered from production lines, sensors, or even ERP, the ML models can help identify the areas with the worst performance (IT Convergence,2022) and produce reports that could support solutions to eliminate the source of inefficiency (Zakaryan, 2022). Thus, by identifying such problem zones, ML can suggest changes in the processes focused on increasing productivity and the work and resource consumption rate.\\n\\nSupply Chain Management\\n\\nAnother benefit is that based on the pattern of past sales and other factors, organizations can forecast demand in the future more effectively with the help of AI (Downie & Finn, 2024). This helps businesses stock products in the correct quantity and eliminate overstocking or stocked-out products. Moreover, AI can analyze the transportation routes, monitor the shipment in real-time, and even determine the potential issues that disrupt the shipment (Oracle, 2023).\\n\\nRobotics and Automation\\n\\nAI ensures that manufacturing lines use robots for monotonous and risky assignments. Such robots can effectively and efficiently adjust and do most tasks that human beings can do but in a much faster and safer manner (ABB, 2023). Moreover, safe and proper interaction between humans and robots is possible through AI, which improves productivity (Lawton, 2020).\\n\\nProduct Design and Development\\n\\nAI can learn more about customers ' choices and trends using customer reviews, social media posts, and other market research data (Experience League, n.d.). AI is also helpful in modeling product performance under various scenarios of use to enhance designs and look for problems encountered in real-life situations (My3DExperience, n.d.).\\n\\nAdvantages of AI and ML in Manufacturing\\n\\nAI and ML increase effectiveness and reduce costs and time wastage by automating operations, improving overall productivity.\\nPredictive maintenance systems can eliminate material failures, and quality assurance can be achieved, thus reducing the number of defective products available in the market (HSO, n.d.).\\n In general, by increasing productivity or reducing the time that some operations take, AI and ML can contribute to cutting expenses (EY, n.d.).\\nAmplifying product development time, reducing it by achieving new product designs, and boosting the rate of innovations (WE Forum, 2024).\\nAI can give important insights and forecasts and back up relevant decisions (Mailchimp, n.d.).\\n Challenges:\\n\\nFrom the analysis results, the efficiency of AI and ML depends entirely on the quality and quantity of data (Reilly, 2024). Organizations do not compromise on the quality of the data, where accuracy and completeness are paramount.\\nThere are also costs to integrating AI and ML, such as tools, hardware, software, and necessary training (Peeler, 2023).\\nPossible ethical implications from AI's application in producing goods include loss of employment to machines and invasion of privacy.\\nAI systems can be hacked for different purposes, so powerful security tools should protect them.\\n Conclusion\\n\\n            AI and ML have taken the manufacturing industries to a new level, where efficiency is observed, quality is enhanced, and cost is eliminated (Loh, 2024). By applying these technologies, the manufacturers can create a competitive edge and prepare for future success. However, the solution is challenging because of factors like inadequate or low-quality data, the cost of implementing AI and ML solutions, and ethical issues crucial for manufacturing industries to defeat to unleash the full potential of AI and ML.\\n\\nReferences:\\n\\nABB.

This work discusses how blockchain has been utilized in the health sector, why it is advantageous in the application, and the problems that are faced when implementing the technology.\\n\\nApplications\\n\\nThe critical case of blockchain in healthcare is enhancing the electronic health records system. A distributed ledger can lead to safe and proper record-keeping and dissemination of patient data since the data is accurate and easily accessible (Mettler, 2016; Abid et al., 2021). This makes patient care more effective because information can easily be transferred from one healthcare professional to the other.\\n\\nPharmaceutical supply chain management is another primary use of the SCP model. It is also possible to identify the origin of drugs through blockchain technology, thus eliminating fake products in the market as they are authenticated (Eyer and Turner, 2021 Haleem et al., 2021). This is especially important in places with high rates of fake products, thus improving public health.\\n\\nThirdly, blockchain assists in research and clinical trials as it guarantees the reliability of the data collected and shared. It ensures data validity and integrity to avoid manipulation and increase the trial\u2019s transparency (Mettler, 2016; Agbo et al., 2019).\\n\\nBenefits\\n\\nBlockchain technology has several advantages in healthcare, as highlighted below. It also increases data confidentiality and integrity through decentralization and cryptography and addresses privacy and security concerns by protecting patients\u2019 records from hacking and data breaches (Pilkington, 2016; Mackey et al., 2019).\\n\\nInteroperability is also enhanced within healthcare systems by creating a blockchain with an unalterable record of transactions. This helps to address challenges of information sharing that increase bureaucracy and hampers the provision of health services (Mettler, 2016; Abid et al., 2021).\\n\\nFurthermore, the use of blockchain enhances accountability in delivering services. Every transaction is stored on the blockchain to corroborate the patient\u2019s records and transactions, which helps build trust between the patients and providers (Eyer & Turner, 2021; Mackey et al., 2019).\\n\\nObstacles\\n\\nHowever, blockchain encounters several challenges in healthcare. The main limitation is scalability: modern ones can face difficulties in working with large amounts of data, which can affect performance and cost (Pilkington, 2016; Agbo et al., 2019).\\n\\nInteroperability with current technology platforms is another matter. Most healthcare organizations employ systems that cannot interoperate with blockchain, thus requiring substantial upgrades and staff education (Eyer & Turner, 2021; Haleem et al., 2021).\\n\\nPotential challenges include the regulatory and legal frameworks. Healthcare is highly regulated, and blockchain implementation should meet legal requirements and standards besides privacy and data security (Mettler, 2016; Mackey et al., 2019).\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nOverall, blockchain solutions hold potential for the future of healthcare by contributing to the development of EHRs, drug-tracking mechanisms, and pharmaceutical research. Some of the advantages, such as security, smooth integration, and openness, are part of what makes them revolutionary. However, issues such as scalability, integration of the system and other existing systems, and regulations that govern the implementation of technological advancement measures must be considered. Depending on the technological improvements, the blockchain system may have great potential to improve healthcare management and its provision.\\n\\n \\n\\nReferences\\n\\nAbid, H., et al. (2021).

One is the shift in medicine applying machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI). This essay will demonstrate the importance of AI and ML in advancing cutting-edge developments in healthcare.  \\n\\nThe Role of AI and ML in Healthcare Digital Transformation\\n\\nIncrease Diagnostic Accuracy\\n\\nAI is accelerating and enhancing disease diagnosis. More specifically, AI imaging technology can significantly increase the precision with which serious illnesses like cancer and heart disease are diagnosed (Pinto-Coelho, 2023). Shed (2018) claims that DeepMind, a Google artificial intelligence system, can diagnose more than 50 eye conditions as accurately as leading medical specialists.\\n\\nAI-assisted radiological diagnostic tools can quickly analyze medical images, especially in the early identification and diagnosis of diseases (Hosny et al., 2018). These accurate test data can effectively improve patient treatment outcomes. From this we can conclude that in the next few years, AI technology has great development potential in the medical industry, both in terms of improving patient care and in the accuracy of medical diagnosis.\\n\\nPersonalized Treatment Plan\\n\\nJavaid et al. (2022) introduced that machine learning algorithms can analyze large amounts of clinical data and disease patterns and then predict patients' pathological responses to different therapies. For example, the SaaS platform IBM Watson for Oncology can evaluate patients\u2019 pathology data through machine learning (ML) technology and then provide trend reports with predictions (Zhou et al., 2019). Medical institutions and doctors can use these reports to analyze the different needs of each patient and customize treatment and care plans.\\n\\nIn cancer diagnosis, ML algorithms can help doctors detect and segment tumors. Machine learning image classification and positioning technology can effectively improve the accuracy of doctors' diagnoses and provide patients with more accurate treatment plans. Today, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been widely used in cancer detection and achieve accurate lesion identification and quantitative analysis (Hermosilla et al., 2024).                \\n\\nImprove Medical Care Level\\n\\nThe growing demand for healthcare services from people after COVID-19 is placing a great deal of stress on the world's limited healthcare resources. Some leading healthcare organizations have introduced AI solutions to support their medical staff by building virtual nursing assistant systems. Curtis et al. (2021) pointed out that virtual nursing assistants can help patients by identifying possible problems, providing medical advice, reminding patients to take medication, making doctor appointments, and monitoring patients' vital signs.\\n\\nFurthermore, remote monitoring and virtual consultations made possible by AI and ML technology allow patients to obtain prompt, high-quality medical treatment whenever needed, no matter where they are. This increases access to healthcare (Chavali et al., 2024).\\n\\nChallenges and Ethical Considerations\\n\\nThe potential disadvantages of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning in the healthcare industry must not be overlooked, as they present risks related to algorithmic bias and data privacy (Elendu et al., 2023). People's reliance on AI-driven decision-making will grow because of technology. This will raise grave concerns about diminished accountability and moral dilemmas within the healthcare sector.\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nIn conclusion, new technology's creativity and advancement to the medical industry should not be undervalued. Medical professionals can create more individualized treatment programs using these technologies, which can also raise medical facilities' detection standards. However, new difficulties often come around as technology advances. Problems that need to be resolved quickly include algorithm bias brought on by inadequate training data sets and ethical data privacy concerns.\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nReference\\n\\nChavali, D., Dhiman, V.

New medical solutions are being brought about by these innovations while on the other hand patient care is being revolutionized and workflow enhanced. That is why according to the research projects the global market of AI in healthcare will be $187.95 billion US dollars by 2030 as illustrated in Figure 1, demonstrating a CAGR of 37% over the period from 2022 to 2030 (Binmile, 2024). This article will examine the significance of AI and ML in the progressing digital transformation of healthcare and their applications, benefits, and maybe, drawbacks.\\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 1. Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare Market Size, 2021-2023 (Binmile, 2024)\\n\\nImproving Diagnostic Accuracy: AI and Machine Learning have brought significant changes to the diagnosis and management of diseases. Machine learning can help review a great deal of patient material, such as medical records, genetics, and imaging, thus helping doctors make quicker and more precise diagnoses. For instance, Aljondi et al. (2023) showed that mammography images of breast cancer could be diagnosed using an AI-based system with the same level of efficiency as radiologists. It can be beneficial in enhancing the prospect of accurate diagnosis as well as enhancing patients\u2019 factors besides reducing healthcare costs.\\n\\nPersonalized Treatment Plans: Among all the applications of AI and ML in the healthcare sector, one of the most promising use cases for growth and successful treatments is precision medicine. It enables the healthcare providers to make the necessary adjustments towards the patients depending on genotype, lifestyle, and other factors regarding their environment. Artificial intelligence can also select proper drugs and appropriate doses for patients; this results in low side effects and higher effectiveness (Vora et al., 2023). Similarly, it is possible to teach machine learning algorithms for distinguishing between real-world data extracted from EHRs and adjusting the treatment programs correspondingly. This use of data as a fundament of care is, therefore, a radical change in the healthcare industry from standardized treatment to more effective treatment programs.\\n\\nTelemedicine and Remote Patient Monitoring: Being at the core of the technologies\u2019 solutions, the COVID-19 epidemic has advanced the implementation of telemedicine and RPM. Smart devices that employ the use of artificial intelligence (AI) also can monitor patients\u2019 parameters, such as temperature and blood pressure, in real-time and ensure the doctors are alerted in case of any fluctuations. Patients with chronic diseases benefit most from this ongoing monitoring because it enables immediate action and lowers hospital visits.

Across the industry, using AI & ML creates value by developing customer experience through monotonous feedback, product recommendations, and chatbots. Not only the consumer side but also the accurate demand forecasting, managing supply chain logistics, AI & ML optimizes all the inventory. Through this, the retail industry can also focus on digital advertisements, dynamic pricing, membership card services, etc. All the data-driven decision-making for this business industry brings high-value insights, making specific strategies for the future. In this research essay, we will discuss the effectiveness of AI & ML in the retail industry by considering the expected consumer expectations, gaining competitive advantage, and more.\\n\\nAI & ML: an Overview\\n\\nThe retail industry, e-commerce to be exact, is constantly evolving digitally through AI and Machine Learning (ML). Retailers are now more engaged with their customers as AI and ML analyze buying patterns and share personalized shopping experiences. Merchants can forecast sales and manage inventory via predictive analytics, resulting in timely product stocking and inventory optimization. E-commerce platforms are using AI-powered chatbots to enrich customer experience, also gathering live feedback to improve sales and product quality. Detection and prevention of fraudulent activities are done by ML algorithms, which analyze transaction anomalies and block out the flagged transactions in real-time. This enhances the security and customer experience, resulting in business stability. These digital transformations (recommendation systems, forecasting, and so on) are backed up by AI and ML, developing an innovation-friendly, customer-centric, and sustainable retail industry.\\n\\nRetail Industry and AI\\n\\nAI has driven growth and created innovative experiences for the industry\u2019s stakeholders. Below are some of the areas through which AI is developing the Retail industry:\\n\\nCustomer Service\\n\\nThe use of AI has enabled customers to shop from different touchpoints that are convenient for them with e-commerce. They have been able to enjoy personalized support through virtual assistants and chatbots. (World Economic Forum, 2023).\\n\\nCost Reduction\\n\\nAI\u2019s ability to streamline and automate processes to free employees of routine tasks has resulted in the efficiency of those processes and enabled staff members to focus on other aspects of business development. (World Economic Forum, 2023).\\n\\nSupply Chain Management\\n\\nRetail\u2019s use of AI enables data analytics to provide insight into stock level and inventory management. (www.forbes.com, 2024).\\n\\nMachine Learning in Retail Industry\\n\\nMachine learning uproots retail to enable businesses to tap into this technology for data-driven insights in making vital decisions and offering customers better experiences. ML algorithms in retail analyze an enormous volume of data, such as customer behavior, sales trends, and inventory levels, to predict demand, personalize marketing efforts, or optimize price strategies (Turkmen, 2022). For instance, ML models can predict future sales by analyzing data from previous years, thereby guiding retailers to manage their stock effectively to avoid running stockouts or overstocking.\\n\\nIn addition, ML enables superior customer experiences through personalized recommendations, explaining and targeting each individual's preferences based on previous purchases and browsing history. Using ML, retailers can also segment customers, pinpoint high-value shoppers, and direct their promotions toward particular demographics. More significantly, chatbots and virtual assistants powered by ML enhance customer service and respond to queries in real-time (Weber & Schutte, 2019). The automation of these procedures improves customer satisfaction and loyalty while also bringing about several efficiencies for retailers. In general, machine learning is a vital tool for any retailer hoping to stay competitive in today's dynamic market.\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nFrom the satisfied consumer\u2019s experience and overall ease and transparency, the use of AI & ML in the retail industry has brought a significant digital transformation. AI & ML help upgrade customer service to a whole new level; they also bring personalized recommendations and effective inventory control. Even fraud detection is much more advanced in the retail industry than before. Through this research essay, we believe in the future, these services will be more seamless and will expand further with more opportunities and easiness.\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nSpencer, A.

It has strongly emphasized manufacturing, warehousing,\\ndistribution, and in-store sales and is known for producing high-quality and long-lasting\\nfurniture (Herman Miller, 2024). In terms of digital operations, Herman Miller's official\\nwebsite is limited to furniture exhibition and scene simulation; it does not offer any online\\ncommercial features that may be converted. Herman Miller's existing operations and business\\nstrategy cannot keep up with the modern furniture market's rapid digital development. As a\\nresult, Herman Miller needs to create a thorough digital transformation plan to surpass\\ncustomer value expectations and preserve its market position.\\nAs a digital strategy consultant, I will use IKEA as a reference in this report to\\npropose a digital transformation strategy for Herman Miller, using Porter's value chain as a\\nframework to analyze the company's current operating status and the directions and areas that\\ncan be improved in the future and help the brand solve the change management challenges\\nnecessary for a successful transformation process.\\nHerman Miller Current Porter's Value Chain Analysis\\nAccording to Byrne (2018), Herman Miller's current Porter value chain includes the\\nfollowing activities:\\nPrimary Activities\\n1. Inbound Logistics\\nA procedure for obtaining and holding high-quality materials guarantees a steady\\nsupply chain necessary for manufacturing (Byrne, 2018). The minimal integration of\\n4\\ntechnology in this conventional process may result in inefficient inventory tracking.\\n2. Operations\\nManufacturing processes consist of lean manufacturing techniques and\\nwell-functioning machines (Byrne, 2018). Its operations mainly rely on manual processes and\\ntraditional machinery, which limits its flexibility and scalability.\\n3. Outbound Logistics\\nThe distribution strategy is mainly to deliver finished products to retail stores and\\ndesignated customers (Byrne, 2018). The lack of an online sales platform prevents reaching a\\nwider audience, which is very unfavorable to the company's market share.\\n4. Marketing and Sales\\nThe main focus of marketing initiatives is on collaborations with retailers and in-store\\npromotions (Byrne, 2018). Herman Miller is losing out on chances to use data-driven\\nmarketing methods because e-commerce is growing so rapidly.\\n5. Service\\nAfter-sales service is managed by the customer service desk in the physical store to\\nhandle returns and repairs (Byrne, 2018). However, Herman Miller's official website lacks\\ndigital customer service platforms like online chat.\\nSupport Activities\\n1. Firm Infrastructure\\nWell-structured management systems focus on financial performance and strategic\\ndecision-making (Byrne, 2018). These infrastructures are more in line with traditional retail\\nbusinesses and lack the technical support required for digital transformation.\\n5\\n2. Human Resource Management\\nThe company achieves its cost-minimization goals by analyzing recruitment and\\ntraining costs and their relative returns (Byrne, 2018). However, employees' current skills\\nneed to be upgraded to master new technologies and digital processes.\\n3. Technology Development\\nThe R&D department is innovative in product design and manufacturing technologies,\\nbut its technology development in digital infrastructure is limited and lacks digital tools to\\nenhance product design, customer engagement, or operational efficiency (Byrne, 2018).\\n4. Procurement\\nThe procurement strategy focuses on procuring high-quality equipment and raw\\nmaterials from reliable suppliers (Byrne, 2018). However, the lack of big data tools in the\\nprocurement process may miss opportunities to save costs or optimize the supply chain.\\nDigital Transformation Strategy for Herman Miller\\nInnovative digital solutions can reduce costs and increase value throughout the value\\nchain of a product (Stern & Ziegler, 2013). The improved value chain will be combined with\\na digital strategy to improve the company's efficiency and customer experience.\\nPrimary Activities\\n1. Digital Inbound Logistics\\nImplement advanced JIT inventory management systems to track and manage\\ninventory in real-time and ensure that the company always has the necessary materials\\nwithout overstocking (Ozturk, 2020).\\n2. Automated Operations\\n6\\nIncorporate artificial intelligence and IoT technologies into manufacturing processes\\nto increase the production speed and value of products (ProductPlan, 2024). This improves\\nefficiency and supports the company's commitment to sustainability by optimizing resource\\nutilization and reducing waste (Chijioke et al., 2024).\\n3. E-commerce Outbound Logistics\\nDevelop a comprehensive e-commerce platform directly on a well-designed official\\nwebsite to provide customers with a seamless shopping experience (Braake, 2023). Logistics\\nintegration with the platform will enable efficient and free delivery services and improve\\ncustomer satisfaction (Dudovskiy, 2022).\\n4. Digital Marketing and Sales\\nUse digital marketing strategies such as SEO, social media marketing, and\\npersonalized online advertising to enhance its brand influence. By creating digital marketing\\ncampaigns that resonate with its customer base to increase consumer brand engagement and\\nsales (Rame et al., 2024).\\n5. Intelligent Service\\nAdd AI-driven customer support systems such as chatbots to improve after-sales\\nservice. Learning from IKEA provides consumers with AR immersive tools to help customers\\nexperience the furniture views in a virtual space before purchasing (Rame et al., 2024).\\nSupport Activities\\n1. Infrastructure Digitalization\\nUpgrade infrastructures through the ERP system, integrating all aspects from finance\\nto supply chain management, thereby providing a unified platform for decision-making and\\n7\\noperational management (AlMuhayfith & Shaiti, 2018; Sriramineni, 2018).\\n2. Human Resources in the Digital Age\\nTrain and improve employees' skills in digital technologies. Create a work\\nenvironment of continuous learning and innovation to help and motivate employees to adapt\\nand accept changes (Olaoye & Potter, 2024).\\n3. Advanced Technology Development\\nDevelop new smart furniture and achieve predictive maintenance and process\\nimprovements through IoT technology (Oracle, 2024).\\n4. Modernized Procurement\\nLeverage big data to stay current on supplier performance, material pricing, and\\nfurniture market trends to inform wiser procurement decisions (Mittal et al., 2023).\\nChange Management Strategy\\nEmployee Concerns\\nAs Herman Miller's digital transformation process continues, some employees may\\nresist change. Technological changes are often accompanied by changes in corporate\\ninterpersonal relationships and personnel structures (Lawrence, 2024). This means that when\\nautomation technology is integrated with Herman Miller's business, many employees may\\nworry about losing their jobs or being unable to adapt to new technologies. Herman Miller\\nneeds to prioritize these issues and improve employee morale to ensure a smooth digital\\ntransformation process.\\nChange Management Model\\nTo address employees' concerns, Herman Miller can consider using Kotter's 8-step\\n8\\nchange model to manage its digital transformation. This structured and comprehensive\\napproach can motivate employees to actively participate in the transformation process and\\nobtain the necessary support and training, thereby reducing the company's resistance during\\nthe transformation process (Minute Tools Content Team, 2021).\\nApplication of Kotter's Model\\nKotter's 8 Steps Change Model is divided into three stages: create a climate for\\nchange, engage and enable the organization, and implement and sustain (Minute Tools\\nContent Team, 2021). This model can help employees acquire the digital skills they need to\\nsucceed, provide ongoing support, and establish feedback loops to ensure that any problems\\nthat arise during digital transformation are resolved effectively.\\n1. Create a Sense of Urgency\\nEmphasize the importance of digital transformation for the company to remain\\ncompetitive in the furniture market with employees. For example, showing the success of\\ncompetitors such as IKEA in the field of digitalization and explains that Herman Miller may\\nlose market share if it does not follow up.\\n2. Form a Guiding Coalition\\nForm a leadership team to drive digital transformation for coordinating resources and\\nproviding support, including executives with digital technology knowledge, influential\\ndepartment heads, and employee representatives who are positive about change.\\n3. Create a Vision\\nThe vision for digital transformation is \\\"Enhancing customer experience through\\ndigital technology and building a world-leading smart furniture company.\\\"\\n9\\n4. Communicate the Vision\\nMake sure that every employee is aware of and supportive of the change's direction\\nby sharing the change's vision with them all via a variety of channels, including internal\\nemails, bulletin boards, online training, and staff meetings.\\n5. Empower Others to Act on the Vision\\nEncourage employees to make suggestions about digital transformation and support\\nthem in trying new digital tools and processes at work.\\n6. Create Quick Wins\\nSet several short-term goals, including launching a new e-commerce platform,\\noptimizing suppliers based on big data analysis, and completing the automated production of\\nchair wheels. After achieving these short-term goals, Herman Miller will promptly recognize\\nand reward employees.\\n7. Build on the Change\\nPrioritize the establishment of e-commerce platforms, and after the e-commerce\\nplatforms obtain stable orders, introduce digital technologies into supply chain management,\\ncustomer service, and other fields to ensure durability.\\n8. Institutionalize the Change\\nAdjust the company's performance evaluation standards, reward system, training\\ncontent, and recruitment standards to ensure that the changes are consolidated and\\ncontinuously applied. Digital transformation can only be truly successful when new ways of\\nworking are deeply rooted in corporate culture.\\n10\\nConclusion\\nIn conclusion, Herman Miller wants to outperform rivals like IKEA by increasing\\nconsumer value through its digital transformation plan. Herman Miller may enhance\\ncustomer satisfaction and broaden its market reach by implementing digital technologies into\\nits operations, marketing, and customer service and updating its supply chain. During the\\ntransformation process, employee engagement, motivation, and support are contingent upon\\nthe implementation of a robust change management approach. This digital transformation\\nwill allow Herman Miller to carry on its heritage of quality and innovation in the digital era.\\n11\\nReference\\nAlMuhayfith, S., & Shaiti, H. (2018).

In-store sales, production, storage, distribution, and other activities make up the company's entire operational spectrum.  It has a strong reputation that it has developed over years of steady performance. The company has a great reputation in the industry, but its online presence is still restricted to a simple website lacking e-commerce features. The company is in an excellent position to improve its operational efficiency and customer engagement through a deliberate digital transformation while the digital landscape keeps changing. \\nThrough this research, I\u2019m aiming to assess the company's existing value chain and suggest a new, digitalized one that makes use of cutting-edge technologies and digital tactics. Determine the possible obstacles and worries that employees have about the digital transformation. Create and implement a change management plan to help guarantee that everything goes well, reduce resistance, and make sure that every employee is aware of the changes and on board. \\n\\nCompany\u2019s current Value Chain Model\\n\\nAccording to Porter\u2019s Value chain model, the whole organization\u2019s processes are divided into two main sectors: primary and support activities. Primary activities contain vital components of the business that directly go towards making revenues, while support activities give the assistance required for the successful completion of the main activities. (Bellantuono, N., Nuzzi, A., Pontrandolfo, P., & Scozzi, B, 2021)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPicture 1. \\nPorter\u2019s Value Chain Model\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nTable 1. \\nCurrent Value Chain Model of GER\\n\\nPrimary Activities\\n\\nInbound LogisticsOperations Outbound Logistics\\n\u2605Procurement - Cooperations with suppliers for purchasing raw materials for product manufacturing. \\n\u2605Inventory management - Efficient warehousing activities that starts from receiving the raw materials, storing raw materials and finished products. All the movements that related to inventory that go in the warehouse should be under control in this part. \u2605Manufacturing - The actual process of making furniture such as, cutting, assembling, polishing, quality check and packaging. \\n\u2605Distribution - Delivery to the retail stores\\n\\n\\nMarketing and Sales\\nService\\n\u2605In-store sales - Only focusing on physical retail stores\\n\u2605Website - Simple product display without online shopping.\u2605Customer support - \\\"Limited to in-store and post-sale services\\\" which means that a company provides particular kinds of customer care and assistance exclusively at their physical location or after sale. \\n\\n\\nSupporting Activities \\n\\nFirm infrastructureHR managementTechnology DevelopmentProcurement\\nRegular business administrative functions including finance and legal. Traditional recruitment, employee management and training.Small-scale IT infrastructure for only internal employee usage. For example: Microsoft applications such as Word and Excel on a daily basis. Manual supplier selection for raw materials and components. Also, make manual calculations of supply chain cost. \\n\\n\\nNew Value Chain Model After Digital Transformation\\n\\nAfter drawing and analyzing the current value chain model of the company, I\u2019d suggest they start their digital transformations by implementing an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system in their business. (Gil-Gomez, H., Guerola-Navarro, V., Oltra-Badenes, R., & Lozano-Quilis, J. A, 2020) Because, the supply chain, manufacturing, sales, customer service, finance, human resources, and other departments all handle key business activities with an ERP system. (Nicovich, S. G., Dibrell, C. C., & Davis, P. S, 2007) Thus, it is one wholesome application that assists in improving the general productivity of a company. Furthermore, it is better if they develop their website and offer online purchasing options to customers through their website. The below table supports the idea that ERP systems and website development can affect and improve the current value chain model after applying the system. \\n\\n\\n\\nTable 2. \\nNew Value Chain Model of GER \\nPrimary Activities\\n\\nInbound Logistics\\n\\n\\n1.Improved supplier integrations - ERP supports supply chain management, that means it helps GER to make informed decisions by giving them access to real-time information on inventory levels, locations, and status.(Gil-Gomez,H., Guerola-Navarro,V.,Oltra-Badenes,R.,& Lozano-Quilis, J. A, 2020)\\n2.ERP makes it easier to coordinate and communicate with suppliers, which guarantees on-time delivery and lowers stockouts.\\n3.Also it assists in balancing inventory levels with anticipated sales by forecasting future demand using analytics and historical data.\\nOperations1.Enhancing productivity and product quality by making use of advanced machinery equipment and technologies besides ERP. Because, automated manufacturing procedures and equipment have the speed and accuracy to complete repeated jobs quickly. \\n2.Materials are easily moved, sorted, and stored more efficiently and with less manual labour. Also, it is useful for tracking defective products. \\nOutbound Logistics1.Enhanced distribution - Increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of the delivery of goods from the warehouse to the designated location. Real-time tracking and route optimization are essential for reaching this ultimate goal. For instance, the system can reroute vehicles to avoid delays in the case of rush hour traffic or road closure.(Gil-Gomez,H.,Guerola-Navarro,V.,Oltra-Badenes,R.,& Lozano-Quilis, J. A, 2020)\\nMarketing and Sales1.E-commerce platform - The main purpose of this platform is smooth and user-friendly buying experience in online stores, which features product customization and safe payment methods. It helps to boost their sales and also gives an opportunity to make a good connection with their customers. (Stackpole, T, 2021)\\n2.Digital marketing - Reach their target market by using social media and email campaigns\\n3.Website development - Virtual showrooms\\nService1.Support and take care of customers after sales by using chatbot, online customer portal and live chats. (Stackpole, T, 2021)\\n2.ERP enhances order tracking and processing, ensuring prompt delivery and increased client satisfaction.\\nSupporting Activities \\nFirm infrastructureExpedites information flow and transactional processes, which speeds up order fulfilment, billing, and financial reporting. \\nHR managementIntegrated employee dataset and simplifies HR tasks including performance management, benefits administration, and payroll. It gives clear information for both employees and the management. \\nTechnology DevelopmentERP systems may be set up on the cloud, providing more flexibility and scalability as well as lowering the requirement for hardware and maintenance at the location. Mobile app and system customization. \\nProcurementAutomated procurement process that can reduce manual tasks including cost calculation, supplier comparison based on historical data, and creating orders. \\n\\n\\nChange Management Strategy\\n\\nChange is an unavoidable part of organizational life due to the rapid advancement of technology, the global economy, and other factors. A planned strategy for easing an organization's shift from its present state\u2014where it is now\u2014to its desired future state is known as change management. (Forrester, 2023) It is the process of updating an organization's capabilities, direction, and structure to meet the constantly evolving needs of both internal and external clients. The procedure and resources used to assist individuals during a shift are also referred to as change management. (Forrester, 2023) In this case, Kotter\u2019s 8-Step change model is the most suitable change management model for GER. \\n1.Sense of urgency - Organise meetings or workshops to raise awareness of the advantages of digital transition. \\n2.Build a guiding coalition - Create a cross-functional team that includes people from marketing, operations, IT, and human resources. Because, we are trying to increase the general productivity of the company, not only one process. \\n3.Form a strategic vision - Make it clear how the future will differ from the past by using digitalization and develop a detailed road map to how to achieve the transformation. (Nicovich, S. G., Dibrell, C. C., & Davis, P. S, 2007) \\n4.Communicate the vision - Motivate employees to actively participate in achieving goals by delivering the message that every individual\u2019s participation is needed for the change.\\n5.Empower action - Eliminate obstacles that slow progress or cause delays in tasks and always be ready for feedback. \\n6.Short-term wins - Always sharing about successes during the transition and letting employees know how close we are to the targeted goal. \\n7.Build on change - Continuously engage with the process and keep motivating all employees as a supervisor, leader, or manager. \\n8.Embed the change - Make clear the connection between the success of the organization and the new behaviors and ensure that these are maintained until they are powerful enough to replace the old ones. (Nicovich, S. G., Dibrell, C. C., & Davis, P. S, 2007) \\nThe probability of an organization achieving its goals is much higher when change management is integrated than when it is not. Significant aspects of the transformation process are addressed by effective change management. For example: It promotes smoother transitions by addressing concerns and doubts that may lead to employee resistance. Ensuring that all stakeholders agree with the project's objectives and encourages open communication about the goals, advantages, and procedures of the change within employees. Furthermore, it creates measures such as KPIs to monitor development and show return on investment, guaranteeing that the transformation delivers observable advantages. (Forrester, 2023)\\n\\nConclusion \\nNow, GER's value chain is based on conventional operations, involving manual procedures or minimal digitally assisted core processes including manufacture, sales, distribution, and procurement. The company's ineffective online presence limits the extent to which it may interact with clients outside of its physical locations. The suggested digital transformation includes building an integrated e-commerce platform and putting in place an ERP system. Inbound logistics, operations, outbound logistics, marketing, sales, and customer service will all be included in this new value chain with modern technologies that are improving customer experiences, increasing efficiency, and simplifying processes. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nReferences\\nBellantuono, N., Nuzzi, A., Pontrandolfo, P., & Scozzi, B.

This will help to continue in providing value to its customers. This research essay will explore the digital transformation of an established furniture company. Porter's Value Chain model will be used to map the current operations and design of a new digital strategy for the company. The change management aspect will also be addressed using suitable theory to guide the process of transformation.\\nCurrent Value Chain of the Traditional Furniture Company\\nThe traditional furniture company has been a main player in the industry. It is known for delivering high-quality and durable products in affordable pricing. The company have been operating for decades and it has created a strong reputation. The organization mainly depends on brick-and-mortar retail stores. However, even though its operations were very successful in the past but now they are facing challenges because of limited digital integration. Other than focusing in departments or cost types for accounting, Porter's Value Chain focuses on systems and the way how inputs are transformed into the outputs bought by consumers (Yun &Yigitcanlar,2017).The following outlines the current value chain based on Porter's model.\\n \\n(Source: Yun &Yigitcanlar,2017)\u2003\\nPorter's model for the Furniture Company\\nPrimary Activities\\nInbound Logistics\uf045Sources raw materials like wood and fabric from long-standing suppliers, storing them in regional warehouses.\\n\uf045Inventory management is manual, leading to inefficiencies such as overstocking and stockouts, which hinder responsiveness to market demand (Miao,2021).\\nOperations\uf045Manufacturing takes place in company-owned factories, where skilled workers emphasize craftsmanship.\\n\uf045The production process is labor-intensive, with limited automation, resulting in high-quality products but reduced scalability and slower production times (Anderson,2020).\\n\uf045Quality control is thorough but manual, which increases the risk of inconsistencies.\\nOutbound Logistics\uf045Finished products are distributed to retail stores using the company's fleet of trucks.\\n\uf045The logistics system lacks real-time tracking, making it difficult to optimize delivery routes and schedules.\\n\uf045Managing inventory across multiple stores is also challenging due to limited visibility into real-time stock levels, leading to potential delays and higher transportation costs(Stars, 2023).\\nMarketing and Sales\uf045The company relies on in-store promotions, print advertisements, and word-of-mouth for marketing.\\n\uf045It has a basic website serving as an online catalog with no e-commerce functionality, limiting its reach to tech-savvy consumers.\\n\uf045The lack of digital marketing tools hampers data collection and personalized marketing efforts (Shankar et al., 2022).\\nService\uf045Customer service is managed through in-store support and a call center, with after-sales services handled manually.\\n\uf045The absence of an integrated system for tracking customer issues result in delays and inconsistencies in service(Rane et al., 2023).\\n\uf045Additionally, the lack of online support limits customer access, reducing the overall customer experience.\\nSupport Activities\\nFirm Infrastructure\uf045The company operates with a hierarchical structure and a basic IT infrastructure that is not well-integrated across departments.\\nHuman Resource Management\uf045Focuses on traditional recruitment and training, with minimal emphasis on digital skills.\\nTechnology Development\uf045Innovation is centered on product design, with little investment in digital technologies.\\nProcurement\uf045Procurement relies on long-term supplier relationships, with manual processes leading to inefficiencies in cost management and supplier interaction.\\nVisual Representation of Existing Value Chain\\n \\n(Source: Created by Author)\\n\u2003\\nNew Value Chain Post-Digital Transformation\\nThe digital transformation strategy for the furniture company considersenhancement of each activity in the value chain based on the integration of digital technologies. The goal is to increase efficiency, reduce expenditure and deliver a great customer experience.The following outlines the new value chain based on Porter's model for the furniture company.\\nNew Value Chain Post-Digital Transformation for the furniture company\\nVisual Representation of Proposed value Chain\\n \\nPrimary Activities\\nInbound Logistics\uf045Implement a digital inventory management system that provides real-time tracking of raw materials.\\n\uf045Introduce supplier portals for better communication and collaboration (Vaka, 2024).\\nOperations\uf045Invest in automation and advanced manufacturing technologies like CNC machines and robotics.\\n\uf045Introduce digital quality control systems to ensure precision and consistency (Pires et al., 2022).\\nOutbound Logistics\uf045Adopt a digital logistics management system with real-time tracking of deliveries (Winkelhaus& Grosse,2020).\\n\uf045Partner with third-party logistics providers to enhance distribution efficiency.\\nMarketing and Sales\uf045Develop a comprehensive e-commerce platform with personalized recommendations and AR/VR features to visualize furniture in customers' homes (Ntumba et al., 2023).\\n\uf045Leverage digital marketing strategies, including social media and SEO, to reach a wider audience.\\nService\uf045Introduce an online customer support system with chatbots and AI-driven solutions (Ali,2024).\\n\uf045Implement a CRM system to manage customer relationships and after-sales services more effectively.\\nSupport Activities\\nFirm Infrastructure\uf045Modernize the IT infrastructure to support digital integration across all departments.\\n\uf045Introduce data analytics and business intelligence tools for better decision-making (Li et al., 2022).\\nHuman Resource Management\uf045Launch a digital training program to upskill employees, focusing on digital literacy and new technologies.\\n\uf045Use digital recruitment platforms to attract tech-savvy talent.\\nTechnology Development\uf045Establish an R&D department focused on digital innovation, exploring new materials, smart furniture, and IoT integration (Frischer et al., 2020).\\n\uf045Invest in software development to enhance product design and customer interaction.\\nProcurement\uf045Implement an e-procurement system to streamline supplier interactions and negotiations.\\n\uf045Use data analytics to optimize procurement strategies and reduce costs (Albinkhalil&Razzaque,2021).\\n\\nChange Management Strategy\\nThe digital transformation of the traditional furniture company needs carefully prepared change management strategy. This is because there will be potential challenges from employees mainly, who have been working since past for the furniture company. They will particularly have fear of change. Implementing new technologies and processes can lead to create uncertainty within employees. This will create resistance to accept the new digital transformation, decreased morality and loss in productivity. To deal with these challenges in effective manner, Kotter\u2019s 8-Step Change Model will be helpful (Trawick &Carraher, 2023). This model offers a structured approach to guide companies through transition. There are 8 stages to this model, which will be explained.\\nStep 1. Create Urgency\\nThe first step is to build a sense of urgency regarding the need for digital transformation. This can be achieved through clearly communicating the risks of not adapting to new environment (Cameron & Green, 2019). Risks such as losing market share to more digitally advanced competitors can be explained. Senior management should highlightfindings on industry trends and the way how digitalization will enhance the company future.\\nStep 2. Form a Powerful Coalition\\nCreating a strong leadership team to address the change is important. This coalition will include influential leaders from various departments. These leaders will lead the transformation, address concerns from employees creating resistance and maintaining motion throughout the process (Errida&Lotfi, 2021). Their contribution is extremely important for overcoming resistance as they are the one who directly communicate with associates.\\nStep 3. Create a Vision for Change\\nDeveloping a clear and compelling vision for the digital transformation helps everyone in the organization in the same track (Klein, 2020). The vision should showcase the way how the transformation will benefit the company, employees and customers. For example, by incorporating new technologies the company can modernize operations. This will createbetter job satisfaction through upskilling.Business can offer customers a better shopping experience. A clarified vision will help employees to understand the bigger picture and understand their role in the change.\\nStep 4. Communicate the Vision\\nEffective communication is important to overcome fear and resistance. The vision and strategy should be communicated promptlythrough meetings, emails and workshops. Open forums for questions and feedback should be provided(Linkedin, 2023). Transparency and regular updates will help to build trust and reduce uncertainty.\\n5. Remove Obstacles\\nStakeholders for change should Identify and address potential barriers to change.This includes outdated policies, lack of resources and resistance from main individuals. Training and support can help employees build confidence regarding new technologies.\\n6. Create Short-Term Wins\\nStakeholders shouldcelebrate short-term wins that will help to maintain momentum and highlight the benefits of the transformation (Errida&Lotfi, 2021). For example, launching a new e-commerce platform can show tangible results, thereby creating the value of the change.\\n7. Build on the Change\\nManagement needs to use the success of short-term wins to achieve further changes. Each win create motivationto proceed to refine processes, address issues and continue building employee confidence in the transformation.\\n8. Anchor the Changes in Corporate Culture\\nTo make sure that the changes adhere, the new digital mindsethas to be inculcated in everyday practices. Leadership must consistently create the importance of digitalization, making sure that the company remains agile and forward-thinking.\\nConclusion\\nWhile concluding it can be said change management is important for successful digital transformation of the traditional furniture company. Through addressing employee fears, a culture of adaptability of new processes will be accepted. This will make sure that change management not only implemented but sustained for long term. Through the structured approach by using Kotter\u2019s 8-Step Model, the company can deal with challenges and align its workforce with the new vision. This will ensure long-term competitiveness and improved efficiency.The value chain will deliver superior customer experience in the competitive digital marketplace.\\n\u2003\\nReferences\\nAlbinkhalil, A.

It has provided quality and decent-priced finished furniture to its corporate and individual customers. RetroWoods products include home and office furniture made with authentic woods sourced all around Canada and processed wood products. It offers finished and non-customized, full-built furniture to its customers. After the Novel coronavirus outbreak, RetroWoods has been facing business challenges due to its operational and limited-service issues, as it has a very conventional business model that has yet to have any touch of modern, data-driven, or even product delivery services to its buyers. The founder, Andy Johnson, wants to transform the technological department of RetroWoods digitally. Sadakat, a technical guru, has been hired to suggest and implement the changes. This study will showcase RetroWood's current value chain and develop a proposed value chain that will positively impact its business. The latter part will be about change management, how the human capital of the company might respond to technological changes, and a proposed change management model to revive their work spirit if otherwise. Lastly, this study will conclude with the overall impact of digital transformation, and the change management model might bring onto RetroWood's business.\\nBackground\\nRetroWoods uses a traditional business model, where customers purchase products only through visiting the store. However, it has a website that shares a product catalog, yet it does not add any additional value since online purchases and related services are unavailable on it. Offered products are finished or fully built large items, and customers need to carry them by means of transportation. It does not have a digital marketing channel for promotion, but it is known by its physical presence of a single outlet with warehouse facility located in Richmond, BC.\\nSadakat has proposed Andy to work with the digital transformation, where the team will develop AI and data-driven website and an app where customers can browse, price match, purchase, schedule deliveries, use the VR to compare and virtually place items at their houses. Customers can ask AI to provide customized interior design so that they can place modified furniture orders with suitable delivery options. The proposed transformation suggested installing a PLC production line, a smart POS system where the buying pattern of a customer will be provided with personalized purchasing options and targeted advertisements through a digital marketing solution where RetroWoods can generate more online sales via webpages and apps. Sadakat has also proposed to develop an e-learning system where staff will be coached about the transformation so that they can provide faster and better customer service. \\nRetroWoods Value Chain\\nThe value chain is referred to as a model that includes each step that a company goes through, from the concept of a product to its production and reaching the end user (Jenkins, 2022). In a nutshell, businesses search each step so that a missing value can be added that a customer wants to spend their money on. The vanilla value chain of RetroWoods has scope limitations to add value (as the case does not provide much information, this study will proceed through assumptions).\\nPrimary Activities\\nInbound logistics\\nInbound logistics include sourcing raw materials from suppliers and maintaining supplier relations. RetroWoods manages high-quality wood and related materials as inventories in its large warehouse in Richmond, BC. It also includes product stocking and down stocking.\\n \\n \\nOperations\\nFurniture production and store operations are two separate operational activities for RetroWoods. Production is based on manual labor, where everything is done and produced by craftsmen. Store operation is simply monitored and supervised by the store manager and sales are done through the salespeople.\\nOutbound Logistics\\nRetroWoods has only one outlet where the production and warehouse facility attached to it. The product distribution to the store is easy, once produced the labors just pull the product to the store for selling. Since the production unit and warehouse are in the same place, inventory management is nothing special. The supervisor uses an Excel sheet to manage all the produced and sold items.\\nMarketing & Sales\\nSince it has been running on a traditional business model, the concept of marketing is very narrow. The old store and the Goodwill built almost twenty years ago are the only marketing beacons. \\nService\\nRetroWoods does not provide any aftersales services to its clients, and the scope is limited. \\nSupport Activities\\nInfrastructure\\nThe company has a centralized decision-making process, where the director makes decisions and is implemented by the managers or supervisors. Once a brand of trust, RetroWood's goodwill is at stake as the competitors have already taken over its market.\\n  \\nHuman Resources Management\\nThe salary and wages are not aligned with the current market and there are hardly any career development options since the operations are flat and limited.\\nTechnology Department\\nRetroWoods does not have any technology department, as all the works are done manually. It only has a webpage that shows the store location and a product catalog. \\nProcurement\\nThe company procures raw materials from local sources that adhere to environmental laws and maintains a good relationship with the supplier. \\nFigure 1\\nRetroWoods current value chain model\\n Note. Value chain of RetroWoods, developed by the author based on assumptions \\nProposed Value Chain\\nPrimary Activities\\nInbound Logistics\\nAccording to the previous value chain, RetroWoods' inbound logistics seems acceptable and may remain unchanged.\\nOperations\\nProposed operations are divided into two parts, production and store. PLC assembly line will be installed to produce furniture in an automated assembly line. It will increase production rates and reduce waste. Smart store layouts will navigate customers to the right aisle for the right product without the help of salespeople. These will reduce labor costs as the company will have fewer laborers to manage.\\nOutbound Logistics\\nThe production floor, warehouse, and outlet are in the same place. Distribution and product replenishment can be maintained without any additional issues. RetroWoods needs to purchase two delivery trucks to deliver customer orders once the transformation takes place.\\nMarketing and Sales\\nA new webpage and an app will be developed to increase customer interaction. Integration of an e-commerce platform will allow customers to purchase online. The proposed webpage and app will be data-driven and AI-based, where customers can browse, price match, purchase, schedule deliveries, and use the VR to compare, and virtually place items at their houses. Customers can ask AI to provide customized interior design so that they can place modified furniture orders with suitable delivery options. The purchase habits of customers will allow the digital marketing solution to show targeted ads. Also, social media advertising and search engine optimization (SEO) will provide RetroWoods to reach a broader audience effectively. Implementing data-driven performance tracking will fine-tune campaigns and strategies in real-time.\\nServices\\nE-learning will coach staff on how to create a welcoming environment for the customers in the store. Also, developing a call center will increase customer interactions. A new return policy for unused items will allow customers to exchange and re-purchase items as per needs. \\nSupport Activities\\nInfrastructure\\nDeveloping a de-centralized decision making will make operations smoother. Managers and supervisors can make business decisions on demand. Developing and integrating new business models through digital transformation will positively impact brand image. \\nHuman Resources Department\\nThe digital transformation will reduce the number of workers since the production will be transformed into PLC systems. However, potential candidates can be moved to admin and salesforce jobs. This will create ample opportunities for the employees to excel in their careers. RetroWoods needs to adjust the pay scale accordingly with the current standard to attract potential people from the labor market. Also, HRD needs to arrange training sessions to improve the skills of the staff.\\nTechnology Department\\nImplementation of the proposed transformation will be the key task of the technology department. Inventory optimization, smart store layout, AI and data-driven webpage and app with VR integration, and smart POS installation will be the key activities of the technology department. \\nProcurement\\nNo change is required for this activity.\\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 2\\nProposed value chain of RetroWoods\\n \\nNote. Proposed value chain developed by the author for RetroWoods\\nChange Management\\nChange management is the execution of a structured process, leading human capital to accomplish as anticipated (Creasey, 2022). Implementation of digital transformation will bring changes in responsibilities, job types, work processes, or even job cuts. There are ample chances employees resist changes.\\nKotter\u2019s 8 Steps Change Model\\nModel, named after John Kotter, focuses on people's side to stimulate their psychology through a series of 8 steps (Hicks, 2022). This study has selected Kotter\u2019s Change Model because it is more suitable for embarking on significant organizational changes and digital transformations (Hicks, 2022).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChange Management Model Described\\nFigure 3\\nKotter\u2019s 8 Step Change Model\\n\\n \\nNote. Author\u2019s idea about the proposed change model to initiate change\\nConclusion\\nImplementing the digital transformation based on data and AI driven solutions will create opportunities for RetroWoods to sustain in the long run. Smart webpage and mobile app will be a game changer along with the VR integration. E-commerce platforms, digital marketing solutions, and SEO will increase sales. Optimized inventory and store layout will increase operational efficiency and customer satisfaction. However, the change in the process and PLC-based production unit will have significant job cuts and employee dissatisfaction. However, it will create ample chances for potential staff to excel in their growth through e-learning skill development. The potential fear of changes among people can be worked out by developing and practicing a proven method of Kotter\u2019s 8-Step Change Model.\\nReferences\\nCreasey, T. (2022, May 18).

Service: \\nFeatherlite's post-sales service approach revolves around ensuring total customer satisfaction by not only meeting but surpassing expectations, prioritizing employee well-being through ergonomic design and safety measures, and addressing evolving safety guidelines for office spaces.\\nSupport Activities:\\n1. Infrastructure:\\nFactory Construction: Featherlite's sustainable factory construction with over 70% recyclable materials emphasizes an infrastructure aligned with sustainability goals (Featherlite Furniture,n.d.).\\nEnergy Management: The net zero carbon positive production through rooftop solar installations demonstrates a commitment to energy efficiency as part of its infrastructure strategy (Featherlite Furniture, n.d.).  \\n2. Human Resource Management: \\nBy focusing on creating tailored solutions, promoting comfort, and enhancing workplace safety, Featherlite underscores its commitment to providing comprehensive support that enhances the work environment for individuals and organizations, fostering productivity and contentment.  \\n3. Procurement:\\nRapidly Renewable Components: Incorporating rapidly renewable materials and ensuring more than 40% of materials are rapidly renewable showcases a sustainable approach to procurement decisions (Featherlite Furniture, n.d.).\\n4. Technological Development:\\nLifecycle Thinking and Modularity: Emphasizing modularity in design, along with a focus on upgrading, modifying, and recycling products, reflects the integration of sustainability into the company's technological development strategy.  \\nDigital Transformation Strategy: \\nIntroducing IoT and AI technologies can transform Featherlite\u2019s value chain activities and lead to increased operational efficiencies, better drive customer satisfaction, enable managerial decision-making and result in overall, superior business performance in today\u2019s world of digital disruption.\\nImprovements or Changes in Value Chain Activities:\\nInbound logistics: IoT sensors can be used to track the position of raw material in real time, thus ordering when necessary. AI algorithms can analyze historical data for accurate demand prediction, optimizing procurement schedules. \\nOperation: IoT-equipped machinery can enable predictive maintenance and performance monitoring, with AI-driven quality control systems ensuring consistent high-quality output (Praxie, n.d.). \\nOutbound logistics: IoT devices in delivery vehicles could track locations, while AI algorithms optimize warehouse operations for efficient order fulfillment. \\nMarketing communication and selling: IoT may collect customer engagement insights, so products may be recommended based on these findings, and AI-based customer relationship management improves the level of customization. \\nService: Smart Customer Feedback technology gathers real time feedback while IOT sales support through 24/7 artificial intelligence chatbots. \\nSupport activities: \\nInfrastructure: IoT sensors optimize energy consumption, and AI algorithms recommend energy-saving strategies. \\nHuman resource management: IoT devices monitor employee well-being and workspace conditions, and AI-based talent management systems enhance employee engagement and retention. \\nProcurement: IoT sensors ensure real-time tracking of raw material shipments for transparency, while AI conducts predictive supplier performance analysis to optimize procurement decisions.\\nAddressing the change management aspect of the digital transformation, Featherlite could introduce strategies such as:\\nConducting thorough communication: \\nForces that drive fear of change in the workforce must be managed by ensuring that there is effective and timely communication outlining the rationale for the changes, their advantages, and the process of adopting them to the workforce. \\nTraining and support: \\nConducting a major training campaign and offering a wide range of support services to the employees, so that they would clearly understand the changes and be prepared for them (Praxie, n.d.). \\nEncouraging participation: \\nIt is advisable to involve the employees in the decision and frequently seek their input to minimise those alterations\u2019 impact. \\nHighlighting the positives: \\nCultivating a message that can also focus on the advantages that new technologies bring, how they can make work activities more effective and enhance people\u2019s attitudes to work. \\nDeveloping a change management team: \\nIt is necessary to have a special staff that would be responsible for the resolution of various worries expressed by employees as well as for the explanation of all the changes that are going to take place shortly. \\nThese measures can largely decrease the employees\u2019 concern regarding change and foster the successful digital transformation. \\nChange Management Model\\nBased on Featherlite\u2019s values and objectives, the best change management model is the ADKAR model. Awareness, desire, knowledge, ability, and reinforcement are the abbreviated forms of ADKAR model, which is useful when dealing with organizational change management.\\nAwareness: \\nFeatherlite must communicate all change policies to all employees especially those that affect integration of new technology in different operations. It is best that such awareness should be thorough, and the manager clearly outline the rationale for the change. \\nDesire: \\nCommunity discusses that it is important to create a desire towards change within an organisation. Employees should be aware of the advantages of existing such technological enhancements; in productivity, convenience for the customers, and a means of bettering the environment. \\nKnowledge: \\nFeatherlite need to give intensive training and information sharing so that the employees can be made aware of these new technologies and how they can be handled appropriately. It was going to entail awareness creation on how to operate on smart IoT sensors, AI and many other technological interventions. \\nAbility: \\nWorkers must have the capacity which enables them to deliver the change process as has been planned. Featherlite should stand by them during this transition, provide advice, technical help, and guarantee that available support is sufficient. \\nReinforcement: \\nOne of the main ideas of such training mode is stabilisation and constant repetition of the new practices to make them permanent (Rios,2023). Informal and formal feedback will be given, progress checked, and successes involving the changes noted to ensure that the changes are become the new organizational standard. \\n With the use of ADKAR model, Featherlite can proactively approach the change that is required for the company to embrace advanced technologies and sustainable change at the operation level. This approach will also not only help in better integration between IoT and AI technology integration but also make sure the employees are on board, motivated as well as ready to adapt it for the growth and success of the company.\\nImportance of Change Management in The Context of Featherlite\u2019s Digital Transformation:\\nSmooth Integration: Change management helps in keeping the impact of new technologies to a minimum while enhancing the gains of adopting the new technologies. \\nEmployee Engagement: Change management trains and involves the employees to adapt to new skill sets and work processes that are coupled with Featherlite\u2019s digitization. \\nOrganizational Alignment: It involves the alteration of all aspects within an organization to ensure that they are all running towards supporting and implementing the changes in the digital system. \\nMinimizing Resistance: This is so since imagery awareness, desire and knowledge can be used to counter resistance to change in favor of new technologies. \\nLong-term Success: They are the keys to managing change which ensures the enhancement of technological adoption, an element that spearheads business development, efficiency, and customer satisfaction.\\nConclusion:\\nWhen an organization like Featherlite is moving toward digital transformation, the importance of change management cannot be overemphasised. Proper integration, involving the employee and ensuring low levels of resistance will enable Featherlite to achieve the appreciation of advanced technologies. In this way, Featherlite with its emphasis on change management brings focus to its digital transformation process; outcomes include maintaining continuous growth, offering a higher quality of customer experience, and optimising its many value chain activities for efficiency.\\n\\nReferences\\n(2024, August 2).

It is a business transformation due to a new generation on information technologies, which makes it possible to increase income and reduce costs. Technologies change the role of the means of providing technology, improving business performance, facilitating sales, providing a competitive advantage, and inventing new business models (Tang, 2021). \\nIndoors Furniture, founded in 1935, began with good raw material and excellent craftsmanship. The business grew from one showroom and workshop in Bombay to a well-structured business concern with mechanized factories and earned the reputation of being the pioneer of Membrane furniture in India. It has two large showrooms in Andheri and Chowpatty, along with a big factory. Today, as a brand, it is very well respected for its quality and customer satisfaction majorly in space saving and multi-furniture solutions. This company is, however, limited to its traditional business model of brick-and-mortar, especially on options of online buying or real-time inventory status (Indoors Furniture, 2023). \\nDue to digitalization today, Indoors Furniture now has the opportunity to professionalize its operations and customer engagement. The current paper examines the Indoors Furniture\u2019s value chain, proposes a digital transformation strategy to provide its enhanced version, and discusses change management strategies for successfully changing traditional brick-and-mortar-focused businesses into modern digitally empowered one.\\n\\nAnalysis of Indoors Furniture\u2019s Current Porter\u2019s Value Chain\\nPorter's Value Chain is one of the key strategic management frameworks focused on understanding and optimizing operations. The model has multiple elements: primary activities such as sourcing inputs, product transformation, and delivery, and secondary activities comprising technological development and administrative activities. Such integration would yield a strong value chain for growth and profitability (FDieffenbacher, 2024). Indoors Furniture\u2019s value chain consists of primary activities and support activities that need to be transformed to adapt to digital advancements.\\nInbound Logistics\\nIndoors Furniture obtains high quality raw materials, which also include imported upholstery. The firm has a large factory in Mumbai. The firm does not find any problem in the supply of raw material to the manufacturing facility through its well-established supply chain (Indoors Furniture, 2023). However, with the implementation of some digital initiatives, much efficiency and transparency in the inventory management can be brought into the current system.\\nOperations\\nThe lines are mechanized, and skilled carpenters are employed by the company. Innovation in space-saving designs by this company has been renowned, and it has pioneered membrane furniture in India (Indoors Furniture, 2023). While the company's craftsmanship or the techniques of production are at par, their integration with Industry 4.0 technologies, such as automation and Industrial IoT sensors (It takes real-time data collected by small sensors within businesses, thus forming the basis for Industry 4.0 in providing insights for better decision-making across different organizational levels) (Immerman, 2023), could bring more efficiency to the operations and products designed (Refer to Figure 1 for the benefits of IOT in the furniture Industry).\\nFigure 1\\nBenefits of using Industry 4.0 technology including IOT in the Furniture Industry\\n \\nNote. From Alsagoff, F., & Alsagoff, F. (2023, July 17). https://picketandrail.com/blogs/furniture-news/how-industry-4-0-is-changing-the-furniture-industry\\nOutbound Logistics\\nFinished products are distributed through two display halls in Andheri and Chowpatty. Due to the lack of e-commerce facilities, Indoors Furniture misses out on a significant portion of their customers (Indoors Furniture, 2023). This can be mitigated by enhancing the current website to support an e-commerce platform, bringing it in a better positioned to receive online orders and handle deliveries, thus expanding the market reach for the company.\\nMarketing and Sales\\nThe focus has been on in-store promotions and word-of-mouth. There is no digital marketing strategy in spite of Indoors Furniture enjoying a good brand reputation. Digital marketing strategies like social media marketing over the present way of only Instagram channel with limited reach (Indoors Furniture, 2023), and personalized email campaigns, could help create more brand visibility, attracting more audiences.\\nService\\nCompany provides customized service to its customers and the ability to procure customized furniture, however their after-sales service is only offered in-store (Indoors Furniture, 2023). Online customer service portals with chatbots, virtual consultations, etc., have to be developed more comprehensively to add serviceability to customers.\\nSupport Activities \\nThe support activities at Indoors Furniture include procurement of quality materials, mechanization of production technology, and human resource management. Nevertheless, the firm's infrastructure and incorporation of technology are more traditional. These support activities can be enhanced using a variety of digital tools and solutions to make them more efficient and effective in general.\\nNew Value Chain and the Proposed Digital Transformation Strategy\\nDigital transformation is the integration of digital technology into the core operations that change fundamentally how the business operates and delivers value. For Indoors Furniture, this would entail an e-commerce platform, data analytics, and adopting digital marketing strategies.\\nNew Porter\u2019s Value Chain for Indoors Furniture\\nInbound Logistics\\nAn up-to-date inventory management system directly integrated with real-time data from suppliers will help to optimize the supply chain. Cloud-based solutions track inventory levels, orders, and shipments to ensure that logistics operations are far more responsive and productive. This will help reduce situations of both stockouts and overstock, thereby improving inventory management in general (STORIS, 2024).\\nOperations\\nAdopting automation and Industry 4.0 technologies (Immerman, 2023) will enhance production efficiency. IoT sensors can monitor production lines in real-time, while 3D modeling software can refine design processes allowing the use of Plastic-Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (ABS) helping in transforming manufacturing by reducing material waste, shortening production times, and lowering labor costs (AIPMA India, n.d). This technological advancement will enable Indoors Furniture to innovate its product offerings and maintain high production standards.\\nOutbound Logistics\\nEnhance the current website to support an e-commerce platform responsible for online orders, deliveries, and customer pickups. Third-party logistics integration will facilitate quick delivery all over the country. Online payment facilities, real-time inventory status, and detailed product pricing on the platform will be enabled. This solves the problem of no e-commerce functionality at present and enhances customer convenience.\\nMarketing and Sales\\nDigital marketing efforts as social media marketing and personalized email campaigns using the extensive database informing about new range, special offers and discounts will increase brand awareness and customer involvement. The e-commerce platform will provide the ability to sell online, enabling Indoors Furniture to reach more customers and offer a more contemporary shopping experience.\\nService\\nCustomer engagement will improve through the implementation of an online customer service portal, live support for self-installation, returns, and refunds. Virtual consultations for designs of custom furniture will make it more personal; traditional service quality merged with modern convenience.\\nComparison with IKEA's Model in India\\nAspect Providing More Value: E-commerce and Digital Service Integration\\n E-commerce and Digital Service Integration is one area where Indoors Furniture can bring more value to the table through digital transformation, compared to IKEA's model in India. Even though IKEA is also extremely digitally present and has an e-commerce platform at its core, Indoors Furniture can differentiate itself by imbuing the online shopping experience with much more personalization.\\nAdvantages\\nLocalized Service. Indoors Furniture can offer free virtual consultation sessions with custom furniture designs on the e-commerce platform providing the benefits of personalized marketing (Pawandeepkaur, 2024), in line with its traditional strengths. That would be an appeal to people who want very tailored solutions that IKEA's paid offerings (Interior Design Service, n.d.) will not fully satisfy or even reach the bulk of their target audience interested in budget furniture.\\nAddressing Local Needs: The reputation Indoors Furniture has built over a longer period within this region can be harnessed in providing products and services attuned to Indian customer preferences, filling a niche demographic, overlooked by the model of IKEA.\\nDigital Transformation and Change Management\\nChange management is the structured process or method of transitioning an individual, group, evolution class lifecycle organization from its current state to a desired future. Effective change management deals with resistance coming from employees and guarantees a seamless implementation of new processes and technologies (5 Steps in the Change Management Process | HBS Online, 2020).\\nIssues and Strategy\\nEmployee Resistance\\nEmployees might be concerned about their employment security or about how to deal with new technologies, absorb skills fast enough, etc. Indoors Furniture may introduce regular training programs that would feature workshops, continuous assistance to upgrade the workforce, and recruit fresh employees who are digitally literate to support transition and close gaps in competencies.\\nChange Management Model\\nADKAR is particularly suited in this scenario. So, in particular, ADKAR, focused on individual transitions and readiness, makes it very instrumental in the case when Indoors Furniture integrates many new digital tools and processes. The model underlines creating awareness, desire, knowledge, ability, and finally, reinforcement. This thus ensures that the employees are not only aware of the changes but are also ready and ready to embrace these changes (G, 2022).\\nConclusion\\nIndoors Furniture's digital transformation is a strategic turn from the traditional brick-and-mortar model to a more contemporary, digitally empowered business. Leveraging advanced technologies, including an e-commerce platform and Industry 4.0 tools, Indoors Furniture can be best in class by introducing free, personalized online services that further enhance value for its customers and hence outshine in one aspect of IKEA's value proposition in India. The ADKAR model will be able to institutionalize successful change management for workforce transition and operations at the company. It will also ensure long-term growth, customer satisfaction, and competitive advantage of the entity in the market.\\n \\nReferences\\n5 steps in the change management process | HBS Online.

Its decentralization and openness provide tremendous possibilities for disrupting how medical info is stored and used. Blockchain was discovered as having great potential to increase the security of data while at the same time working on the issue of data sharing between the decentralized system in healthcare and patient-centered care. However, this technology as much as it holds a lot of potential has several drawbacks about scalability, legal issues, and use cases within the healthcare landscape.\\n\\nApplications of Blockchain in Healthcare\\n\\nBlockchain's key healthcare applications include:\\n\\nElectronic Health Records (EHRs): The solution also gives the patient full control of his/her health information and allows the exchange between health care providers to be safe and efficient.\\nMobile Health & Remote Monitoring: Blockchain assists in the storage and management of biomedical data that will be sourced from remote health devices for real-time access and security.\\nHealth Insurance Claims: verification and compensation activities are done automatically through smart contracts in blockchain to reduce on fraud and increase on efficiency (Zeeve, 2024).\\nClinical Trials: Blockchain brings flexibility to unlock different locks of data, through which clinical trials can be managed and monitored effectively.\\nPharmaceutical Supply Chain: Blockchain enhances the supply chain provenance and thus reduces on entry of fake drugs into the market.\\nBenefits of Blockchain in Healthcare\\n\\nEnhanced Data Security: Blockchain does not have a single entry point that can be targeted by cybercriminals which helps protect the health data (Haleem, et. al., 2021).\\nInteroperability: Blockchain affords an enhanced method in which institutions can safely and effectively share data to enhance the healthcare sector.\\nTraceability: Real-time information updates in the chain of pharmaceutical products avoid cases of fraud.\\nAutomated Record-Keeping: Smart contracts can enhance and expedite the generation of medical records while reducing human error or occupation of experts for the same (Zeeve, 2024).\\nFraud Reduction: Blockchain can mitigate health care fraud and abuse since the records on the blockchain can improve data transparency.\\nThe Guide Of Blockchain In Healthcare\\n\\n(Source: Zeeve, 2024)\\n\\nObstacles\\n\\nScalability: Some of these systems are challenged with scalability in terms of handling the number of transactions which is an important aspect in healthcare due to the vast data that it deals with.\\nRegulatory Compliance: The implementation of blockchain systems in healthcare comes up with challenges in meeting the healthcare regulations for data privacy such as HIPAA in the USA or GDPR in the European Union (Haleem, et. al., 2021).\\nHigh Implementation Costs: Adapting and incorporating blockchain into the current structures of the healthcare sector involves costs that may not be easily affordable by the current small-scale developed providers.\\nTechnical Expertise: The use of blockchain requires some expertise and understanding, and there are still many healthcare organizations that do not have the right talent and technical support.\\nConclusion\\n\\nBased on the results, blockchain has potential use cases in the healthcare field, especially in enhancing information sharing, openness, and patient-centredness. These include application in EHR management, medicine supply chain, and clinical trials hence improving the healthcare processes. However, there are issues like scalability, regulatory issues, and high implementation cost which is a major drawback before blockchain can be implemented to be a solution in health care. It entails that the advancement of technology as well as overcoming these hurdles will lead to the radical change of the healthcare system for the better.\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nReferences\\n\\nZeeve, (2024).

It has been used in several industries such as supply chain management, healthcare and education. In this discussion, I will talk about the applications, benefits and possible challenges people might face of blockchain in supply chain management.\\n\\nApplications, Benefits and Challenges\\n\\nIn supply chain management, we mostly need to deal with complex data, they are huge data volumes, and we also need to update some important data for us to track in real time. Blockchain can make the supply chain management more efficient and transparent. In my research, Walmart and IBM Food Trust are working together to use supply chains to track the source of foods. Through blockchain, Walmart can track products from different suppliers at the same time. (Sristy, 2021) In this example, blockchain has the advantages of being tamper-proof, easy to build trust and high transparency between users. Walmart can better provide consumers with information on the source of food. Even if food safety issues occur, they can be handled quickly and accurately, which is impossible with other methods. (Hyperledger, n.d.) And as we mentioned in class, blockchain can also help the diamond industry track the source of their diamonds and mark information. No matter how a \\\"diamond\\\" circulates and who it passes through, it is always \\\"that diamond\\\" and the information cannot be tampered with. (Because it is almost impossible to change the node information of all users at the same time). This greatly helps diamond merchants and customers build trust through high transparency (because all relevant users can access the records), rather than taking years to build trust in the past. However, we also need to pay attention to some challenges faced by applying blockchain. For example, high initial costs, high technological thresholds and our current lack of relevant legal and regulatory systems for the supply chain. High technological thresholds and high initial costs will cause a small business to face difficulties because they have just started. Large companies also need to apply blockchain through employee training. At the same time, the company will also face some legal charges.\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nIn general, blockchain is a beneficial technology for us, and more and more industries are finding ways to use it. It can bring benefits such as high security and high transparency to transactions; however, we cannot ignore its high threshold and possible challenges such as legal charges.\\n\\n \\n\\nReference\\n\\nHyperledger.

It really grounds your points.\\n- **Suggestion**: Try to connect your challenges section more directly to your examples.

In order to help with some of the challenges faced by supply chain participants, blockchain, the digital record-keeping system created for cryptocurrency networks, can offer a thorough, transparent, and unchangeable history of the financial, inventory, and information flows in transactions.  \\n\\nThe primary purpose of blockchain technology is to allow an infinite number of anonymous people to deal safely and secretly with one another without the need for a central middleman in cryptocurrency networks intended to replace fiat currencies. In the context of supply chains, this means enabling a small group of well-known parties to safeguard their commercial activities from dishonest parties while fostering improved efficiency. New standards for representing transactions on a block, new permissioned blockchains, and new system regulations are all necessary for successful blockchain applications for supply chains. These standards are now in different phases of development.\\n\\nThe Uses and Advantages of Blockchain in Supply Chain Management \\n\\nTraceability: Should a company discover a defective product, its supply chain partners can use blockchain technology to locate the product, identify all suppliers associated with it, identify batches related to manufacturing and shipping, and promptly recall it. When a commodity is perishable, like fresh food and some medications, the blockchain enables participating businesses to automatically check its quality: Any dangerous temperature variations can be recorded on the blockchain using a refrigerated container fitted with an internet of things (IoT) device to monitor the temperature (Using Blockchain to Drive Supply Chain Transparency, n.d.). Furthermore, since counterfeit goods wouldn't have a blockchain verification history, the blockchain can ease merchant concerns about the legitimacy of a returned product. \\n\\nIncreasing efficiency and speed and reducing disruptions: Walmart Canada has started utilizing blockchain technology in its relationships with the trucking businesses who move its products. Trucking companies may track shipments, coordinate logistical data, and automate payments using a shared blockchain without having to make major adjustments to their IT infrastructure or internal business procedures, Gaur (2020).\\n\\nThe fact that these applications, like those for enhancing traceability, only require participating organizations to share a minimum amount of data in this case, merely inventory or shipment data makes adopting blockchain to improve supply chain efficiency and speed all the more appealing. Furthermore, even in big businesses with numerous ERP systems, these apps are helpful.\\n\\nImproving financing, contracting, and international transactions.\\n\\nThe sharing of inventory, data, and financial flows across businesses via a blockchain can lead to major improvements in contracts, international trade, and supply chain financing. Think about the issue of funding. An established issue pertaining to information asymmetry concerning the nature of a borrower firm's operations, the caliber of its assets, and its obligations affects banks who extend working capital and trade credit to businesses. For instance, a business may take out many bank loans secured by the same asset or apply for a loan for one use and then utilize it for another. Banks build their systems to manage these kinds of risks, which drives up transaction costs, impedes capital availability, and lowers the amount of money available to small businesses. These conflicts are bad for businesses as well as banks.\\n\\nConclusion \\n\\nSupply chains can be made much better in terms of funding, coordination, end-to-end traceability, and product delivery speed. Blockchain, as demonstrated by the businesses we looked at, can be an effective solution for fixing the shortcomings. Now is the moment for supply chain managers who have been idly watching blockchain technology to evaluate how it can benefit their companies. They must participate in the initiatives to create new regulations, try out new technologies, run trials with different blockchain platforms, and create an ecosystem with other businesses. Sure, some resources will need to be committed, but there should be a good return on that investment.\\n\\nReferences \\n\\nGaur, V. (2020, April 14). Building a transparent supply chain.

It is not merely limited to the current usual use in business deals since it has many advantages and solutions to problems.\\n\\nApplication & Benefits of Blockchain in the Real Estate Industry\\n\\nOne of the most apparent uses of blockchain in real estate is managing records such as title deeds. This is because records of ownership information stored in the property are achieved through a blockchain that cannot be edited, saving the trouble of fraud, mistakes, or lost papers. This enhanced credibility and efficiency in using blockchain and associated technologies could transform property transaction flows, making them less time-consuming, more efficient, and more secure (Mipim World Blog, n.d.).\\n\\nIn addition, blockchain can solve the problem of diversification of ownership, which implies the ability to invest a certain amount in each property without necessarily owning such property. By democratizing real estate ownership, there may be improved liquidity and lower costs that enhance the accessibility of investment property (reAlpha, 2024).\\n\\nReal estate transactions can also benefit from smart contracts, which are automated contracts that convert the conditions of a contract or agreement into digital code (Imenso, 2024). These contracts can include payment of rent, lease extension or renewal, and other administrative tasks in properties, eliminating middlemen and cutting expenses (Imenso, 2024).\\n\\nChallenges Associated with the Application of Blockchain in Real Estate\\n\\nHowever, some challenges are associated with implementing blockchain in real estate. In its path, there are challenges such as regulatory challenges, scalability issues, and the issue of compatibility between the various blockchain systems. Another aspect that requires consideration is the protection of privacy and security of real estate information.\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nTherefore, blockchain technology holds the key to addressing most of the problems in the real estate sphere. Blockchain can revolutionize property buying, selling, and management by improving features such as transparency, security, efficiency, and ease. With the advances in this technology, the real estate market has been revolutionized significantly.\\n\\nReferences\\n\\n(2024, May 1).

In this essay, the author will discuss the potential of blockchain technology in the healthcare system, the potential uses, and benefits of blockchain implementation, and potential problems that the healthcare industry will have to solve to integrate the blockchain into its services.\\n\\nApplications in Healthcare\\n\\n            Blockchain is a great innovation that has many use cases for making healthcare even better especially in the management and security of patient records. Through decentralization and immutability, blockchain ensures that patient data is shared with members from different health facilities while excluding unauthorized people (Haleem et al., 2021). It must also be noted that the application of this technology can improve the pharmaceutical supply chain thus resulting in improvement of the quality of medication available in the market and subsequently, patient safety.\\n\\nBenefits of Blockchain Implementation\\n\\n            The use of blockchain technology in healthcare has several benefits as follows. Firstly, it increases the security of data and patients\u2019 privacy by offering an open yet easily encrypted system for saving and exchanging medical records. Secondly, blockchain can save time and money in administrative procedures, thereby making changes beneficial in healthcare organizations (Atadoga et al., 2024). Furthermore, it helps to provide accurate and timely clinical trial data, which may improve medical research and drug development.\\n\\nObstacles to Adoption\\n\\n            However, there are several challenges facing the integration of blockchain in the healthcare industry. One of the primary issues is the interfacing with other healthcare IT systems that are currently implemented and not always compatible with a blockchain structure. Also, there are concerns over the integration of blockchain systems to manage a large amount of healthcare data produced every day (Ali et al., 2023). \\n\\nConclusion\\n\\n            The opportunity to apply Blockchain technology in the health industry is vast and could prove crucial in improving the healthcare structure and making it more secure, efficient, and effective. But to become pervasive, technical, regulatory, and integration barriers must be addressed. Knowing that the technology is still in development, once these obstacles are eliminated, blockchain has the potential to become an essential part of the modern healthcare system.\\n\\nReferences\\nAtadoga, A., Elufioye, O.

Its potential to store and secure data in a decentralized manner has unfolded opportunities to revolutionize conventional academic systems. Blockchain can enhance data security, transparency, and trust in credential verification, making it a precious device for each educator and learners. However, no matter its potential, the era faces big boundaries that avert its massive adoption in the education sector.\\n\\nApplication\\n\\nOne of the most promising programs of blockchain in education is in credential verification. Traditionally, verifying academic credentials has been a time-ingesting and bulky process. With blockchain, establishments can save students' certificates and transcripts on an immutable ledger, permitting employers and other groups to verify qualifications quickly and successfully. This process reduces the hazard of credential fraud and increases accept as true with among instructional establishments and outside stakeholders (Zhu & Wang, 2021). Additionally, blockchain can facilitate micro-credentialing, which allows students to earn digital certificates for specific skills and capabilities, enhancing lifelong mastering opportunities (Appinventiv, 2023).\\n\\nAdvantages\\n\\nAnother significant benefit of blockchain in education is data security and privacy. Educational institutions manage giant amounts of sensitive data, along with non-public information, academic information, and monetary details. Blockchain's decentralized nature guarantees that this data is stored securely and is on the market simplest to legal users. This can protect college students' privacy and decrease the danger of cyber-assaults (Appinventiv, 2023).\\n\\nLimitations\\n\\nDespite these benefits, several limitations prevent the considerable adoption of blockchain in schooling. One fundamental assignment is the dearth of technical understanding inside instructional institutions. Implementing blockchain technology requires specialized understanding that many schools and universities may not own. Additionally, blockchain structures are still in their early tiers of improvement and integrating them with present educational infrastructures may be complex and high priced (Mikroyannidis, 2021). Furthermore, concerns approximately data scalability and the environmental effect of blockchain's power consumption are also giant limitations (Zhu & Wang, 2021).\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nBlockchain generation holds massive ability to convert the education sector by way of enhancing credential verification, information protection, and the overall getting to know revel in. However, its implementation continues to be in its infancy, and various technical and logistical demanding situations need to be addressed before it may be extensively adopted. Overcoming those limitations will require elevated collaboration among instructional establishments, governments, and technology carriers. As blockchain continues to evolve, its packages in education will probably end up more sophisticated, ultimately benefiting college students, educators, and establishments alike.\\n\\nReferences\\n\\nAppinventiv.

Blockchain makes transactions more transparent, safer, and efficient. Blockchain uses smart contracts, which greatly simplifies the transaction process(Saberi et al., 2019). Smart contracts can automatically execute and verify the terms in real estate transactions. When all terms are met, they can be automatically executed, reducing dependence on intermediaries and speeding up the process. Blockchain can also improve property management. In some countries, land registration occasionally suffers from false or human errors. Blockchain can set the registration form to be unchangeable, and all property records cannot be changed once they enter the system, which improves security and transparency.\\n\\nAdvantages\\n\\nBlockchain has played a lot of promoting roles in the real estate industry. It increases the transparency of the transaction process, and all transaction details are recorded in the system. Both parties can view it, understand the real-time situation of the transaction, and reduce the risks in buying and selling. Blockchain can also reduce everyone's dependence on intermediaries and reduce the cost of transactions. And this cost reduction can promote more people to enter the real estate investment market. The application of blockchain also improves data security and reduces the risk of data forgery and ownership disputes. The simplification of real estate processes increases liquidity in the real estate market, because blockchain real estate assets can be marked as digital shares for sale, which makes it easier for investors and makes investment more frequent. And this method allows some people who do not have the resources to buy a whole property to have the opportunity to invest in the real estate industry.\\n\\nObstacles\\n\\nAlthough blockchain has greatly promoted the real estate industry, it also contains many challenges(Swan, 2015). For example, there is uncertainty in regulation. Blockchain technology raises legal difficulties, particularly about smart contract validity and enforceability, in the highly regulated real estate business. Governments and regulators must adapt the framework to blockchain transactions, which will take time. New technologies are slow to embrace in real estate.The implementation of blockchain systems requires technical support, but most real estate professionals do not have the relevant capabilities. However, the application of blockchain in the real estate industry is currently in its infancy, and now a large amount of technology investment and training is urgently needed. Data privacy is also a huge challenge. Blockchain increases the transparency of real estate transactions, but it also comes with some problems. If system records are not managed properly, information can be easily leaked. How to manage and protect information in the system is a key challenge.\\n\\nConclusion\\n\\nBlockchain has sped up and secured real estate transactions, but numerous issues remain. We still have many issues and must fully use blockchain.  In terms of supervision and data privacy, we must be cautious. Efforts to develop blockchain applications and successfully integrate blockchain with the real estate industry are future goals.\\n\\nReference\\n\\nSaberi, S., Kouhizadeh, M., Sarkis, J., & Shen, L.
