It has strongly emphasized manufacturing, warehousing,\\ndistribution, and in-store sales and is known for producing high-quality and long-lasting\\nfurniture (Herman Miller, 2024). In terms of digital operations, Herman Miller's official\\nwebsite is limited to furniture exhibition and scene simulation; it does not offer any online\\ncommercial features that may be converted. Herman Miller's existing operations and business\\nstrategy cannot keep up with the modern furniture market's rapid digital development. As a\\nresult, Herman Miller needs to create a thorough digital transformation plan to surpass\\ncustomer value expectations and preserve its market position.\\nAs a digital strategy consultant, I will use IKEA as a reference in this report to\\npropose a digital transformation strategy for Herman Miller, using Porter's value chain as a\\nframework to analyze the company's current operating status and the directions and areas that\\ncan be improved in the future and help the brand solve the change management challenges\\nnecessary for a successful transformation process.\\nHerman Miller Current Porter's Value Chain Analysis\\nAccording to Byrne (2018), Herman Miller's current Porter value chain includes the\\nfollowing activities:\\nPrimary Activities\\n1. Inbound Logistics\\nA procedure for obtaining and holding high-quality materials guarantees a steady\\nsupply chain necessary for manufacturing (Byrne, 2018). The minimal integration of\\n4\\ntechnology in this conventional process may result in inefficient inventory tracking.\\n2. Operations\\nManufacturing processes consist of lean manufacturing techniques and\\nwell-functioning machines (Byrne, 2018). Its operations mainly rely on manual processes and\\ntraditional machinery, which limits its flexibility and scalability.\\n3. Outbound Logistics\\nThe distribution strategy is mainly to deliver finished products to retail stores and\\ndesignated customers (Byrne, 2018). The lack of an online sales platform prevents reaching a\\nwider audience, which is very unfavorable to the company's market share.\\n4. Marketing and Sales\\nThe main focus of marketing initiatives is on collaborations with retailers and in-store\\npromotions (Byrne, 2018). Herman Miller is losing out on chances to use data-driven\\nmarketing methods because e-commerce is growing so rapidly.\\n5. Service\\nAfter-sales service is managed by the customer service desk in the physical store to\\nhandle returns and repairs (Byrne, 2018). However, Herman Miller's official website lacks\\ndigital customer service platforms like online chat.\\nSupport Activities\\n1. Firm Infrastructure\\nWell-structured management systems focus on financial performance and strategic\\ndecision-making (Byrne, 2018). These infrastructures are more in line with traditional retail\\nbusinesses and lack the technical support required for digital transformation.\\n5\\n2. Human Resource Management\\nThe company achieves its cost-minimization goals by analyzing recruitment and\\ntraining costs and their relative returns (Byrne, 2018). However, employees' current skills\\nneed to be upgraded to master new technologies and digital processes.\\n3. Technology Development\\nThe R&D department is innovative in product design and manufacturing technologies,\\nbut its technology development in digital infrastructure is limited and lacks digital tools to\\nenhance product design, customer engagement, or operational efficiency (Byrne, 2018).\\n4. Procurement\\nThe procurement strategy focuses on procuring high-quality equipment and raw\\nmaterials from reliable suppliers (Byrne, 2018). However, the lack of big data tools in the\\nprocurement process may miss opportunities to save costs or optimize the supply chain.\\nDigital Transformation Strategy for Herman Miller\\nInnovative digital solutions can reduce costs and increase value throughout the value\\nchain of a product (Stern & Ziegler, 2013). The improved value chain will be combined with\\na digital strategy to improve the company's efficiency and customer experience.\\nPrimary Activities\\n1. Digital Inbound Logistics\\nImplement advanced JIT inventory management systems to track and manage\\ninventory in real-time and ensure that the company always has the necessary materials\\nwithout overstocking (Ozturk, 2020).\\n2. Automated Operations\\n6\\nIncorporate artificial intelligence and IoT technologies into manufacturing processes\\nto increase the production speed and value of products (ProductPlan, 2024). This improves\\nefficiency and supports the company's commitment to sustainability by optimizing resource\\nutilization and reducing waste (Chijioke et al., 2024).\\n3. E-commerce Outbound Logistics\\nDevelop a comprehensive e-commerce platform directly on a well-designed official\\nwebsite to provide customers with a seamless shopping experience (Braake, 2023). Logistics\\nintegration with the platform will enable efficient and free delivery services and improve\\ncustomer satisfaction (Dudovskiy, 2022).\\n4. Digital Marketing and Sales\\nUse digital marketing strategies such as SEO, social media marketing, and\\npersonalized online advertising to enhance its brand influence. By creating digital marketing\\ncampaigns that resonate with its customer base to increase consumer brand engagement and\\nsales (Rame et al., 2024).\\n5. Intelligent Service\\nAdd AI-driven customer support systems such as chatbots to improve after-sales\\nservice. Learning from IKEA provides consumers with AR immersive tools to help customers\\nexperience the furniture views in a virtual space before purchasing (Rame et al., 2024).\\nSupport Activities\\n1. Infrastructure Digitalization\\nUpgrade infrastructures through the ERP system, integrating all aspects from finance\\nto supply chain management, thereby providing a unified platform for decision-making and\\n7\\noperational management (AlMuhayfith & Shaiti, 2018; Sriramineni, 2018).\\n2. Human Resources in the Digital Age\\nTrain and improve employees' skills in digital technologies. Create a work\\nenvironment of continuous learning and innovation to help and motivate employees to adapt\\nand accept changes (Olaoye & Potter, 2024).\\n3. Advanced Technology Development\\nDevelop new smart furniture and achieve predictive maintenance and process\\nimprovements through IoT technology (Oracle, 2024).\\n4. Modernized Procurement\\nLeverage big data to stay current on supplier performance, material pricing, and\\nfurniture market trends to inform wiser procurement decisions (Mittal et al., 2023).\\nChange Management Strategy\\nEmployee Concerns\\nAs Herman Miller's digital transformation process continues, some employees may\\nresist change. Technological changes are often accompanied by changes in corporate\\ninterpersonal relationships and personnel structures (Lawrence, 2024). This means that when\\nautomation technology is integrated with Herman Miller's business, many employees may\\nworry about losing their jobs or being unable to adapt to new technologies. Herman Miller\\nneeds to prioritize these issues and improve employee morale to ensure a smooth digital\\ntransformation process.\\nChange Management Model\\nTo address employees' concerns, Herman Miller can consider using Kotter's 8-step\\n8\\nchange model to manage its digital transformation. This structured and comprehensive\\napproach can motivate employees to actively participate in the transformation process and\\nobtain the necessary support and training, thereby reducing the company's resistance during\\nthe transformation process (Minute Tools Content Team, 2021).\\nApplication of Kotter's Model\\nKotter's 8 Steps Change Model is divided into three stages: create a climate for\\nchange, engage and enable the organization, and implement and sustain (Minute Tools\\nContent Team, 2021). This model can help employees acquire the digital skills they need to\\nsucceed, provide ongoing support, and establish feedback loops to ensure that any problems\\nthat arise during digital transformation are resolved effectively.\\n1. Create a Sense of Urgency\\nEmphasize the importance of digital transformation for the company to remain\\ncompetitive in the furniture market with employees. For example, showing the success of\\ncompetitors such as IKEA in the field of digitalization and explains that Herman Miller may\\nlose market share if it does not follow up.\\n2. Form a Guiding Coalition\\nForm a leadership team to drive digital transformation for coordinating resources and\\nproviding support, including executives with digital technology knowledge, influential\\ndepartment heads, and employee representatives who are positive about change.\\n3. Create a Vision\\nThe vision for digital transformation is \\\"Enhancing customer experience through\\ndigital technology and building a world-leading smart furniture company.\\\"\\n9\\n4. Communicate the Vision\\nMake sure that every employee is aware of and supportive of the change's direction\\nby sharing the change's vision with them all via a variety of channels, including internal\\nemails, bulletin boards, online training, and staff meetings.\\n5. Empower Others to Act on the Vision\\nEncourage employees to make suggestions about digital transformation and support\\nthem in trying new digital tools and processes at work.\\n6. Create Quick Wins\\nSet several short-term goals, including launching a new e-commerce platform,\\noptimizing suppliers based on big data analysis, and completing the automated production of\\nchair wheels. After achieving these short-term goals, Herman Miller will promptly recognize\\nand reward employees.\\n7. Build on the Change\\nPrioritize the establishment of e-commerce platforms, and after the e-commerce\\nplatforms obtain stable orders, introduce digital technologies into supply chain management,\\ncustomer service, and other fields to ensure durability.\\n8. Institutionalize the Change\\nAdjust the company's performance evaluation standards, reward system, training\\ncontent, and recruitment standards to ensure that the changes are consolidated and\\ncontinuously applied. Digital transformation can only be truly successful when new ways of\\nworking are deeply rooted in corporate culture.\\n10\\nConclusion\\nIn conclusion, Herman Miller wants to outperform rivals like IKEA by increasing\\nconsumer value through its digital transformation plan. Herman Miller may enhance\\ncustomer satisfaction and broaden its market reach by implementing digital technologies into\\nits operations, marketing, and customer service and updating its supply chain. During the\\ntransformation process, employee engagement, motivation, and support are contingent upon\\nthe implementation of a robust change management approach. This digital transformation\\nwill allow Herman Miller to carry on its heritage of quality and innovation in the digital era.\\n11\\nReference\\nAlMuhayfith, S., & Shaiti, H. (2018).
