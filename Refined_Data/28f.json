Because it wanted to 'chair-ish' the future!\\\"\\n\\nYour analysis of Featherlite's current value chain is spot on, particularly the emphasis on sustainability and localized sourcing. The digital transformation strategy you proposed, especially with IoT and AI integration, reflects a deep understanding of operational improvements and customer satisfaction.\\n\\nOne suggestion: while you did a great job outlining the value chain changes, the section on change management could be even stronger with more specific examples of how Featherlite will engage its employees at different stages. More details on the practical implementation of the ADKAR model would help solidify your strategy.\\n\\nOverall, your approach is well-rounded and clearly tailored to Featherliteâ€™s goals!"
