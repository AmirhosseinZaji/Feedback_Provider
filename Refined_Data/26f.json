Sounds like trying to get a couch to code—comfy, but a slow learner!\\\"\\n\\nYou did a solid job mapping out the company's current state with Porter’s Value Chain. The clear breakdown of activities like inbound logistics, operations, and marketing really helps set the stage for the transformation strategy.\\n\\nThe change management section could be a bit tighter. While Kotter’s model is well-explained, it would be great to see more concrete examples of how you’ll create urgency or get short-term wins specific to this industry. Think more about how employees in a traditional company might react to new tech, and get even more practical with those steps.\\n\\nNice work! Keep up the momentum!"
