Fantastic! Just be sure to highlight how this could differentiate GER from competitors beyond just functionality.\\nSuggestion:\\n\\nOne area that could be more emphasized is customer data. You could expand on how GER could use the data collected from e-commerce and ERP to predict trends and personalize offers.\\nGreat effort here!
