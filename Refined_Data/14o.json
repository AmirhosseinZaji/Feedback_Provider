Primary activity includes inbound logistics, operations, outbound logistics, marketing/sales, and after-sales service. Support activity includes company infrastructure, human resources, technology department, and procurement. \\n\\nPrimary Activities\\n\\n Trader Joe’s inbound logistics involves sourcing products from suppliers, maintaining supplier relations, product inventory, and replenishment. Efficient store layout and providing a positive customer experience is a part of its operational activity. A centralized distribution model, product distribution to stores, and inventory management are the key activities that fall under outbound logistics. Trader Joe's has a unique marketing technique, word-of-mouth, and a customer-centric approach that differentiates them from competitors (Burke, 2024). Customer-centric return policy and support are their forte, and they help them retain customers.\\n\\nSupport Activities\\n\\nTrader Joe's has a solid organizational culture and brand identity that differentiates it from its competitors. It follows a decentralized decision-making process, which speeds up work. Competitive wages/salaries, benefits, and career growth reduce employee turnover and dissatisfaction. The company also provides employees with developmental support to make them more engaged and focused, as it believes a happy employee means a happy customer (Burke, 2024). Trader Joe's uses solutions to optimize inventory and store operations. The tracking system in POS machines fetches customer buying patterns used as targeted marketing.

(stripe.com, 2023). Although the company does not run a delivery service, it can partner with Uber Eats to deliver online orders to customers. (Tardi, 2024).\\n\\nMarketing/Sales\\n\\nTrader Joe’s does not do “traditional marketing”. (Tardi, 2024). However, it can reach a wider audience through digital marketing campaigns where customers take their favorite Trader Joe’s in-store images and experiences to post on their respective social/new media handles. Customers can be incentivized to engage in the promotion, and AI algorithms can be deployed to monitor the efficacy of the promotion.\\n\\nService\\n\\nAI assistants can be deployed on the e-commerce platform to create an excellent customer service experience.\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nProposed new diagram\\n\\nA screenshot of a computerDescription automatically generated\\n\\nThe reason behind choosing the new value chain\\n\\nIntegrating e-commerce, online marketing, and real-time customer service into Trader Joe's value chain closes significant business gaps and aligns the company with shifting consumer preferences. In this respect, a secure e-commerce platform can be integrated for online order placement to increase the convenience of customers and expand its base, both extremely crucial steps in today's digital landscape. This is certainly offset by partnering with delivery services like Uber Eats so that customers can get their favorite products without a visit to the store. Also, with AI-driven social media marketing, brand visibility and customer engagement are hugely maximized to keep up in today's competitive market. Finally, AI assistants implemented within the e-commerce platform improve customer service to ensure a smooth shopping experience that might influence customer loyalty and retention. These strategic applications of technology drive not just modernization at Trader Joe's; they also better place it in line to grab new market opportunities.\\n\\n \\n\\nCalculation\\n\\nMargin= (Total value created by a company's activities-Cost of performing the activities)\\nIncreased sales generated from the secured payment e-commerce site & app - the cost of building the app/site = margin.\\nThe sales revenue generated from increased market share - the cost of AI algorithms and incentives given to customers to run the digital campaign = margin.\\nThe value derived from customer retention online - the cost of online AI assistants = margin.\\nEstimated Calculations\\n\\n Increased Sales Value from e-commerce\\nProjected increased sales: $30 million per year (Assumptions)\\n\\nPlatform building and maintenance cost: $5 million.\\n\\nMargin = (increased Sales - Platform Building cost)\\n\\nMargin=$30 million-$5 million=$25 million\\n\\nIncreased sales return value from Digital Marketing\\nProjected increase in sales: $15 million per annum.\\n\\nThe cost of AI algorithms and incentives: $2 million\\n\\nMargin=$15 million−$2 million=$13 million\\n\\nE-Commerce Platform:\\nEstimated Increased Revenue from Retained Customers: $10 million annually due to improved customer service.\\n\\nCost of Implementing AI Assistants: $3 million.\\n\\nMargin=Increased Revenue from Retained Customers−Cost of AI Assistants\\n\\nMargin=$10 million−$3 million=$7 million\\n\\n                                                      Conclusion\\n        After the margin is calculated, the new proposed value chain seems to have a significant impact with a differentiated positioning in the market for Trader Joe’s. It contributed the operational success and better consumer feedback than before. Still the company needs to fill up some possible gaps regarding e-commerce, digital marketing, real time customer support to remain competitive to grow in the business.
