This will help to continue in providing value to its customers. This research essay will explore the digital transformation of an established furniture company. Porter's Value Chain model will be used to map the current operations and design of a new digital strategy for the company. The change management aspect will also be addressed using suitable theory to guide the process of transformation.\\nCurrent Value Chain of the Traditional Furniture Company\\nThe traditional furniture company has been a main player in the industry. It is known for delivering high-quality and durable products in affordable pricing. The company have been operating for decades and it has created a strong reputation. The organization mainly depends on brick-and-mortar retail stores. However, even though its operations were very successful in the past but now they are facing challenges because of limited digital integration. Other than focusing in departments or cost types for accounting, Porter's Value Chain focuses on systems and the way how inputs are transformed into the outputs bought by consumers (Yun &Yigitcanlar,2017).The following outlines the current value chain based on Porter's model.\\n \\n(Source: Yun &Yigitcanlar,2017) \\nPorter's model for the Furniture Company\\nPrimary Activities\\nInbound LogisticsSources raw materials like wood and fabric from long-standing suppliers, storing them in regional warehouses.\\nInventory management is manual, leading to inefficiencies such as overstocking and stockouts, which hinder responsiveness to market demand (Miao,2021).\\nOperationsManufacturing takes place in company-owned factories, where skilled workers emphasize craftsmanship.\\nThe production process is labor-intensive, with limited automation, resulting in high-quality products but reduced scalability and slower production times (Anderson,2020).\\nQuality control is thorough but manual, which increases the risk of inconsistencies.\\nOutbound LogisticsFinished products are distributed to retail stores using the company's fleet of trucks.\\nThe logistics system lacks real-time tracking, making it difficult to optimize delivery routes and schedules.\\nManaging inventory across multiple stores is also challenging due to limited visibility into real-time stock levels, leading to potential delays and higher transportation costs(Stars, 2023).\\nMarketing and SalesThe company relies on in-store promotions, print advertisements, and word-of-mouth for marketing.\\nIt has a basic website serving as an online catalog with no e-commerce functionality, limiting its reach to tech-savvy consumers.\\nThe lack of digital marketing tools hampers data collection and personalized marketing efforts (Shankar et al., 2022).\\nServiceCustomer service is managed through in-store support and a call center, with after-sales services handled manually.\\nThe absence of an integrated system for tracking customer issues result in delays and inconsistencies in service(Rane et al., 2023).\\nAdditionally, the lack of online support limits customer access, reducing the overall customer experience.\\nSupport Activities\\nFirm InfrastructureThe company operates with a hierarchical structure and a basic IT infrastructure that is not well-integrated across departments.\\nHuman Resource ManagementFocuses on traditional recruitment and training, with minimal emphasis on digital skills.\\nTechnology DevelopmentInnovation is centered on product design, with little investment in digital technologies.\\nProcurementProcurement relies on long-term supplier relationships, with manual processes leading to inefficiencies in cost management and supplier interaction.\\nVisual Representation of Existing Value Chain\\n \\n(Source: Created by Author)\\n \\nNew Value Chain Post-Digital Transformation\\nThe digital transformation strategy for the furniture company considersenhancement of each activity in the value chain based on the integration of digital technologies. The goal is to increase efficiency, reduce expenditure and deliver a great customer experience.The following outlines the new value chain based on Porter's model for the furniture company.\\nNew Value Chain Post-Digital Transformation for the furniture company\\nVisual Representation of Proposed value Chain\\n \\nPrimary Activities\\nInbound LogisticsImplement a digital inventory management system that provides real-time tracking of raw materials.\\nIntroduce supplier portals for better communication and collaboration (Vaka, 2024).\\nOperationsInvest in automation and advanced manufacturing technologies like CNC machines and robotics.\\nIntroduce digital quality control systems to ensure precision and consistency (Pires et al., 2022).\\nOutbound LogisticsAdopt a digital logistics management system with real-time tracking of deliveries (Winkelhaus& Grosse,2020).\\nPartner with third-party logistics providers to enhance distribution efficiency.\\nMarketing and SalesDevelop a comprehensive e-commerce platform with personalized recommendations and AR/VR features to visualize furniture in customers' homes (Ntumba et al., 2023).\\nLeverage digital marketing strategies, including social media and SEO, to reach a wider audience.\\nServiceIntroduce an online customer support system with chatbots and AI-driven solutions (Ali,2024).\\nImplement a CRM system to manage customer relationships and after-sales services more effectively.\\nSupport Activities\\nFirm InfrastructureModernize the IT infrastructure to support digital integration across all departments.\\nIntroduce data analytics and business intelligence tools for better decision-making (Li et al., 2022).\\nHuman Resource ManagementLaunch a digital training program to upskill employees, focusing on digital literacy and new technologies.\\nUse digital recruitment platforms to attract tech-savvy talent.\\nTechnology DevelopmentEstablish an R&D department focused on digital innovation, exploring new materials, smart furniture, and IoT integration (Frischer et al., 2020).\\nInvest in software development to enhance product design and customer interaction.\\nProcurementImplement an e-procurement system to streamline supplier interactions and negotiations.\\nUse data analytics to optimize procurement strategies and reduce costs (Albinkhalil&Razzaque,2021).\\n\\nChange Management Strategy\\nThe digital transformation of the traditional furniture company needs carefully prepared change management strategy. This is because there will be potential challenges from employees mainly, who have been working since past for the furniture company. They will particularly have fear of change. Implementing new technologies and processes can lead to create uncertainty within employees. This will create resistance to accept the new digital transformation, decreased morality and loss in productivity. To deal with these challenges in effective manner, Kotter’s 8-Step Change Model will be helpful (Trawick &Carraher, 2023). This model offers a structured approach to guide companies through transition. There are 8 stages to this model, which will be explained.\\nStep 1. Create Urgency\\nThe first step is to build a sense of urgency regarding the need for digital transformation. This can be achieved through clearly communicating the risks of not adapting to new environment (Cameron & Green, 2019). Risks such as losing market share to more digitally advanced competitors can be explained. Senior management should highlightfindings on industry trends and the way how digitalization will enhance the company future.\\nStep 2. Form a Powerful Coalition\\nCreating a strong leadership team to address the change is important. This coalition will include influential leaders from various departments. These leaders will lead the transformation, address concerns from employees creating resistance and maintaining motion throughout the process (Errida&Lotfi, 2021). Their contribution is extremely important for overcoming resistance as they are the one who directly communicate with associates.\\nStep 3. Create a Vision for Change\\nDeveloping a clear and compelling vision for the digital transformation helps everyone in the organization in the same track (Klein, 2020). The vision should showcase the way how the transformation will benefit the company, employees and customers. For example, by incorporating new technologies the company can modernize operations. This will createbetter job satisfaction through upskilling.Business can offer customers a better shopping experience. A clarified vision will help employees to understand the bigger picture and understand their role in the change.\\nStep 4. Communicate the Vision\\nEffective communication is important to overcome fear and resistance. The vision and strategy should be communicated promptlythrough meetings, emails and workshops. Open forums for questions and feedback should be provided(Linkedin, 2023). Transparency and regular updates will help to build trust and reduce uncertainty.\\n5. Remove Obstacles\\nStakeholders for change should Identify and address potential barriers to change.This includes outdated policies, lack of resources and resistance from main individuals. Training and support can help employees build confidence regarding new technologies.\\n6. Create Short-Term Wins\\nStakeholders shouldcelebrate short-term wins that will help to maintain momentum and highlight the benefits of the transformation (Errida&Lotfi, 2021). For example, launching a new e-commerce platform can show tangible results, thereby creating the value of the change.\\n7. Build on the Change\\nManagement needs to use the success of short-term wins to achieve further changes. Each win create motivationto proceed to refine processes, address issues and continue building employee confidence in the transformation.\\n8. Anchor the Changes in Corporate Culture\\nTo make sure that the changes adhere, the new digital mindsethas to be inculcated in everyday practices. Leadership must consistently create the importance of digitalization, making sure that the company remains agile and forward-thinking.\\nConclusion\\nWhile concluding it can be said change management is important for successful digital transformation of the traditional furniture company. Through addressing employee fears, a culture of adaptability of new processes will be accepted. This will make sure that change management not only implemented but sustained for long term. Through the structured approach by using Kotter’s 8-Step Model, the company can deal with challenges and align its workforce with the new vision. This will ensure long-term competitiveness and improved efficiency.The value chain will deliver superior customer experience in the competitive digital marketplace.\\n \\nReferences\\nAlbinkhalil, A.
