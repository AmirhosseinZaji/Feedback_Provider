New medical solutions are being brought about by these innovations while on the other hand patient care is being revolutionized and workflow enhanced. That is why according to the research projects the global market of AI in healthcare will be $187.95 billion US dollars by 2030 as illustrated in Figure 1, demonstrating a CAGR of 37% over the period from 2022 to 2030 (Binmile, 2024). This article will examine the significance of AI and ML in the progressing digital transformation of healthcare and their applications, benefits, and maybe, drawbacks.\\n\\n\\n\\nFigure 1. Artificial Intelligence in Healthcare Market Size, 2021-2023 (Binmile, 2024)\\n\\nImproving Diagnostic Accuracy: AI and Machine Learning have brought significant changes to the diagnosis and management of diseases. Machine learning can help review a great deal of patient material, such as medical records, genetics, and imaging, thus helping doctors make quicker and more precise diagnoses. For instance, Aljondi et al. (2023) showed that mammography images of breast cancer could be diagnosed using an AI-based system with the same level of efficiency as radiologists. It can be beneficial in enhancing the prospect of accurate diagnosis as well as enhancing patients’ factors besides reducing healthcare costs.\\n\\nPersonalized Treatment Plans: Among all the applications of AI and ML in the healthcare sector, one of the most promising use cases for growth and successful treatments is precision medicine. It enables the healthcare providers to make the necessary adjustments towards the patients depending on genotype, lifestyle, and other factors regarding their environment. Artificial intelligence can also select proper drugs and appropriate doses for patients; this results in low side effects and higher effectiveness (Vora et al., 2023). Similarly, it is possible to teach machine learning algorithms for distinguishing between real-world data extracted from EHRs and adjusting the treatment programs correspondingly. This use of data as a fundament of care is, therefore, a radical change in the healthcare industry from standardized treatment to more effective treatment programs.\\n\\nTelemedicine and Remote Patient Monitoring: Being at the core of the technologies’ solutions, the COVID-19 epidemic has advanced the implementation of telemedicine and RPM. Smart devices that employ the use of artificial intelligence (AI) also can monitor patients’ parameters, such as temperature and blood pressure, in real-time and ensure the doctors are alerted in case of any fluctuations. Patients with chronic diseases benefit most from this ongoing monitoring because it enables immediate action and lowers hospital visits. AI-enhanced telemedicine solutions offer virtual consultations, increasing patient convenience and accessibility to health (Tech Roles to Lead Employment Growth in the Healthcare Sector: Expert, n.d.).\\n\\nConclusion:  In conclusion, AI and ML solutions implemented in healthcare are contributing to new technologies aimed at improving patient outcomes, efficiency in the diagnosis process, remote patient monitoring, and treatment methodologies. As these technologies evolve and are integrated into the healthcare field, they stand the chance of becoming key agents of change for the future development of the health sector.\\n\\n \\n\\n \\n\\nReferences\\n\\nAljondi, R., Alghamdi, S.
