  "content": "\\\"Blockchain in education—maybe soon degrees will come with a 'block' party!\\\"\\n\\nNow for the feedback:\\n\\nWell done: Your explanation of blockchain’s potential in credential verification is clear and practical. You’ve covered both the benefits and limitations nicely.\\nNext step: The section on limitations could benefit from a specific example of how an educational institution struggles with the technical understanding or costs of implementing blockchain. It would make the analysis more grounded. Keep up the good work!"
