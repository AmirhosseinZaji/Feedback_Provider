"Blockchain in education—maybe soon degrees will come with a 'block' party!"

Now for the feedback:

Well done: Your explanation of blockchain’s potential in credential verification is clear and practical. You’ve covered both the benefits and limitations nicely.
Next step: The section on limitations could benefit from a specific example of how an educational institution struggles with the technical understanding or costs of implementing blockchain. It would make the analysis more grounded. Keep up the good work!
