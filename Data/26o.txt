Introduction
In the modern business environment where digitalization is modifying industries, a traditional furniture company is required to adapt towards maintaining competitiveness. This will help to continue in providing value to its customers. This research essay will explore the digital transformation of an established furniture company. Porter's Value Chain model will be used to map the current operations and design of a new digital strategy for the company. The change management aspect will also be addressed using suitable theory to guide the process of transformation.
Current Value Chain of the Traditional Furniture Company
The traditional furniture company has been a main player in the industry. It is known for delivering high-quality and durable products in affordable pricing. The company have been operating for decades and it has created a strong reputation. The organization mainly depends on brick-and-mortar retail stores. However, even though its operations were very successful in the past but now they are facing challenges because of limited digital integration. Other than focusing in departments or cost types for accounting, Porter's Value Chain focuses on systems and the way how inputs are transformed into the outputs bought by consumers (Yun &Yigitcanlar,2017).The following outlines the current value chain based on Porter's model.

Change Management Strategy
The digital transformation of the traditional furniture company needs carefully prepared change management strategy. This is because there will be potential challenges from employees mainly, who have been working since past for the furniture company. They will particularly have fear of change. Implementing new technologies and processes can lead to create uncertainty within employees. This will create resistance to accept the new digital transformation, decreased morality and loss in productivity. To deal with these challenges in effective manner, Kotter’s 8-Step Change Model will be helpful (Trawick &Carraher, 2023). This model offers a structured approach to guide companies through transition. There are 8 stages to this model, which will be explained.
Step 1. Create Urgency
The first step is to build a sense of urgency regarding the need for digital transformation. This can be achieved through clearly communicating the risks of not adapting to new environment (Cameron & Green, 2019). Risks such as losing market share to more digitally advanced competitors can be explained. Senior management should highlightfindings on industry trends and the way how digitalization will enhance the company future.
Step 2. Form a Powerful Coalition
Creating a strong leadership team to address the change is important. This coalition will include influential leaders from various departments. These leaders will lead the transformation, address concerns from employees creating resistance and maintaining motion throughout the process (Errida&Lotfi, 2021). Their contribution is extremely important for overcoming resistance as they are the one who directly communicate with associates.
Step 3. Create a Vision for Change
Developing a clear and compelling vision for the digital transformation helps everyone in the organization in the same track (Klein, 2020). The vision should showcase the way how the transformation will benefit the company, employees and customers. For example, by incorporating new technologies the company can modernize operations. This will createbetter job satisfaction through upskilling.Business can offer customers a better shopping experience. A clarified vision will help employees to understand the bigger picture and understand their role in the change.
Step 4. Communicate the Vision
Effective communication is important to overcome fear and resistance. The vision and strategy should be communicated promptlythrough meetings, emails and workshops. Open forums for questions and feedback should be provided(Linkedin, 2023). Transparency and regular updates will help to build trust and reduce uncertainty.
5. Remove Obstacles
Stakeholders for change should Identify and address potential barriers to change.This includes outdated policies, lack of resources and resistance from main individuals. Training and support can help employees build confidence regarding new technologies.
6. Create Short-Term Wins
Stakeholders shouldcelebrate short-term wins that will help to maintain momentum and highlight the benefits of the transformation (Errida&Lotfi, 2021). For example, launching a new e-commerce platform can show tangible results, thereby creating the value of the change.
7. Build on the Change
Management needs to use the success of short-term wins to achieve further changes. Each win create motivationto proceed to refine processes, address issues and continue building employee confidence in the transformation.
8. Anchor the Changes in Corporate Culture
To make sure that the changes adhere, the new digital mindsethas to be inculcated in everyday practices. Leadership must consistently create the importance of digitalization, making sure that the company remains agile and forward-thinking.
