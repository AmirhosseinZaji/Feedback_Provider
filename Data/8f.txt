"Blockchain in healthcare—sounds like soon we’ll need a doctor just to decode all the 'blocks'! But hey, at least the patient records will be secure!"

Now for the feedback:

Clear points: You've done a good job outlining the key applications and benefits of blockchain in healthcare, especially around data security and reducing admin tasks.
To strengthen: Expand on the challenges a bit more. For instance, scalability is mentioned, but providing a real-world example of how a hospital might struggle with it could make your argument more concrete. Keep pushing forward!
