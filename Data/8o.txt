Blockchain in Healthcare

Blockchain was a technology introduced to decentralize financial transactions and has been prominent in changing and revolutionizing the healthcare sector (Haleem et al., 2021). Some common applications of blockchain within healthcare include the development of ERP or the ability to manage Electronic Health Records. The healthcare industry requires strong storage, protection, and management of patient data, which makes EHR extremely helpful. This technology enables tamper-proof storage of patient data, ensures the efficiency of the medical staff and reduces medical errors (Haleem et al., 2021). 

In terms of the benefits of blockchain in healthcare, one of the most important factors is data security and enabling health organizations to mitigate risks such as cyberattacks and other data breaches (Haleem et al., 2021). Moreover, blockchain also helps automate admin tasks, thus reducing costs and fast-tracking the billing and insurance-related processes (Urwin, 2024). 

Finally, even with constant innovation, scalability is a major challenge or obstacle within the adaptability of blockchain in healthcare (Odilibe et al., 2024). Moreover, standardization is also something that needs a closer look (Urwin, 2024).

For an industry like healthcare, blockchain has thus been instrumental in transforming traditional functions but still has progress to make.
