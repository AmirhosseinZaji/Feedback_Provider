Introduction 

Trader Joe's, one of the most famous nationwide brands with a network of neighbourhood grocers, has always put much emphasis on offering customers value and quality shopping experiences. Known for offering high-end, non-promotional items at low prices and with reduced use of coupons or membership, Trader Joe’s sustains the sale of private brands. To overcome existing business deficiencies, the Technological department has suggested expanding its use of information technologies to improve its operations and, accordingly, the worth of its value chain. 

Current Porter’s Value Chain model: 

Suppliers enable negotiation for reduced prices for unique products while using just-in-time inventory techniques to maintain product freshness and reduce the need for large warehouses (Shaw, A. A., 2024). They cooperate with different manufacturing companies to expand product choices reduce costs and utilize a centralized distribution model for efficient delivery and inventory circulation. Furthermore, they focus on in-store sales through various marketing campaigns and prioritize outstanding customer service (Shaw, A. A., 2024). Trader Joe's also employs a highly decentralized support model for store managers, emphasizes employee development, and invests in innovative retail technologies. Additionally, the company maintains a meticulous approach to selecting reliable vendors.
