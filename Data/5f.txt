"Blockchain in real estate—soon we’ll be buying houses in one block and selling them in the next block!"

Now for the feedback:

Well-organized: Your breakdown of applications and benefits is clear and easy to follow. The example of title deeds and smart contracts is particularly strong.
To enhance: You mention challenges like regulatory issues and scalability, but expanding on how these specific challenges play out in real-world real estate scenarios would make your argument more compelling. A case study could add depth.
