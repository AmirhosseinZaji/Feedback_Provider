Digital Transformation Strategy for Indoors Furniture: Increasing Value Through Modernization
Digital transformation is not just the innovative use of information technologies in business. It is a business transformation due to a new generation on information technologies, which makes it possible to increase income and reduce costs. Technologies change the role of the means of providing technology, improving business performance, facilitating sales, providing a competitive advantage, and inventing new business models (Tang, 2021). 
Indoors Furniture, founded in 1935, began with good raw material and excellent craftsmanship. The business grew from one showroom and workshop in Bombay to a well-structured business concern with mechanized factories and earned the reputation of being the pioneer of Membrane furniture in India. It has two large showrooms in Andheri and Chowpatty, along with a big factory. Today, as a brand, it is very well respected for its quality and customer satisfaction majorly in space saving and multi-furniture solutions. This company is, however, limited to its traditional business model of brick-and-mortar, especially on options of online buying or real-time inventory status (Indoors Furniture, 2023). 
Due to digitalization today, Indoors Furniture now has the opportunity to professionalize its operations and customer engagement. The current paper examines the Indoors Furniture’s value chain, proposes a digital transformation strategy to provide its enhanced version, and discusses change management strategies for successfully changing traditional brick-and-mortar-focused businesses into modern digitally empowered one.

Analysis of Indoors Furniture’s Current Porter’s Value Chain
Porter's Value Chain is one of the key strategic management frameworks focused on understanding and optimizing operations. The model has multiple elements: primary activities such as sourcing inputs, product transformation, and delivery, and secondary activities comprising technological development and administrative activities. Such integration would yield a strong value chain for growth and profitability (FDieffenbacher, 2024). Indoors Furniture’s value chain consists of primary activities and support activities that need to be transformed to adapt to digital advancements.
Inbound Logistics
Indoors Furniture obtains high quality raw materials, which also include imported upholstery. The firm has a large factory in Mumbai. The firm does not find any problem in the supply of raw material to the manufacturing facility through its well-established supply chain (Indoors Furniture, 2023). However, with the implementation of some digital initiatives, much efficiency and transparency in the inventory management can be brought into the current system.
Operations
The lines are mechanized, and skilled carpenters are employed by the company. Innovation in space-saving designs by this company has been renowned, and it has pioneered membrane furniture in India (Indoors Furniture, 2023). While the company's craftsmanship or the techniques of production are at par, their integration with Industry 4.0 technologies, such as automation and Industrial IoT sensors (It takes real-time data collected by small sensors within businesses, thus forming the basis for Industry 4.0 in providing insights for better decision-making across different organizational levels) (Immerman, 2023), could bring more efficiency to the operations and products designed (Refer to Figure 1 for the benefits of IOT in the furniture Industry).

Outbound Logistics
Finished products are distributed through two display halls in Andheri and Chowpatty. Due to the lack of e-commerce facilities, Indoors Furniture misses out on a significant portion of their customers (Indoors Furniture, 2023). This can be mitigated by enhancing the current website to support an e-commerce platform, bringing it in a better positioned to receive online orders and handle deliveries, thus expanding the market reach for the company.
Marketing and Sales
The focus has been on in-store promotions and word-of-mouth. There is no digital marketing strategy in spite of Indoors Furniture enjoying a good brand reputation. Digital marketing strategies like social media marketing over the present way of only Instagram channel with limited reach (Indoors Furniture, 2023), and personalized email campaigns, could help create more brand visibility, attracting more audiences.
Service
Company provides customized service to its customers and the ability to procure customized furniture, however their after-sales service is only offered in-store (Indoors Furniture, 2023). Online customer service portals with chatbots, virtual consultations, etc., have to be developed more comprehensively to add serviceability to customers.
Support Activities 
The support activities at Indoors Furniture include procurement of quality materials, mechanization of production technology, and human resource management. Nevertheless, the firm's infrastructure and incorporation of technology are more traditional. These support activities can be enhanced using a variety of digital tools and solutions to make them more efficient and effective in general.
New Value Chain and the Proposed Digital Transformation Strategy
Digital transformation is the integration of digital technology into the core operations that change fundamentally how the business operates and delivers value. For Indoors Furniture, this would entail an e-commerce platform, data analytics, and adopting digital marketing strategies.
New Porter’s Value Chain for Indoors Furniture
Inbound Logistics
An up-to-date inventory management system directly integrated with real-time data from suppliers will help to optimize the supply chain. Cloud-based solutions track inventory levels, orders, and shipments to ensure that logistics operations are far more responsive and productive. This will help reduce situations of both stockouts and overstock, thereby improving inventory management in general (STORIS, 2024).
Operations
Adopting automation and Industry 4.0 technologies (Immerman, 2023) will enhance production efficiency. IoT sensors can monitor production lines in real-time, while 3D modeling software can refine design processes allowing the use of Plastic-Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene (ABS) helping in transforming manufacturing by reducing material waste, shortening production times, and lowering labor costs (AIPMA India, n.d). This technological advancement will enable Indoors Furniture to innovate its product offerings and maintain high production standards.
Outbound Logistics
Enhance the current website to support an e-commerce platform responsible for online orders, deliveries, and customer pickups. Third-party logistics integration will facilitate quick delivery all over the country. Online payment facilities, real-time inventory status, and detailed product pricing on the platform will be enabled. This solves the problem of no e-commerce functionality at present and enhances customer convenience.
Marketing and Sales
Digital marketing efforts as social media marketing and personalized email campaigns using the extensive database informing about new range, special offers and discounts will increase brand awareness and customer involvement. The e-commerce platform will provide the ability to sell online, enabling Indoors Furniture to reach more customers and offer a more contemporary shopping experience.
Service
Customer engagement will improve through the implementation of an online customer service portal, live support for self-installation, returns, and refunds. Virtual consultations for designs of custom furniture will make it more personal; traditional service quality merged with modern convenience.
Comparison with IKEA's Model in India
Aspect Providing More Value: E-commerce and Digital Service Integration
 	E-commerce and Digital Service Integration is one area where Indoors Furniture can bring more value to the table through digital transformation, compared to IKEA's model in India. Even though IKEA is also extremely digitally present and has an e-commerce platform at its core, Indoors Furniture can differentiate itself by imbuing the online shopping experience with much more personalization.
Advantages
Localized Service. Indoors Furniture can offer free virtual consultation sessions with custom furniture designs on the e-commerce platform providing the benefits of personalized marketing (Pawandeepkaur, 2024), in line with its traditional strengths. That would be an appeal to people who want very tailored solutions that IKEA's paid offerings (Interior Design Service, n.d.) will not fully satisfy or even reach the bulk of their target audience interested in budget furniture.
Addressing Local Needs: The reputation Indoors Furniture has built over a longer period within this region can be harnessed in providing products and services attuned to Indian customer preferences, filling a niche demographic, overlooked by the model of IKEA.
Digital Transformation and Change Management
Change management is the structured process or method of transitioning an individual, group, evolution class lifecycle organization from its current state to a desired future. Effective change management deals with resistance coming from employees and guarantees a seamless implementation of new processes and technologies (5 Steps in the Change Management Process | HBS Online, 2020).
Issues and Strategy
Employee Resistance
Employees might be concerned about their employment security or about how to deal with new technologies, absorb skills fast enough, etc. Indoors Furniture may introduce regular training programs that would feature workshops, continuous assistance to upgrade the workforce, and recruit fresh employees who are digitally literate to support transition and close gaps in competencies.
Change Management Model
ADKAR is particularly suited in this scenario. So, in particular, ADKAR, focused on individual transitions and readiness, makes it very instrumental in the case when Indoors Furniture integrates many new digital tools and processes. The model underlines creating awareness, desire, knowledge, ability, and finally, reinforcement. This thus ensures that the employees are not only aware of the changes but are also ready and ready to embrace these changes (G, 2022).
Conclusion
Indoors Furniture's digital transformation is a strategic turn from the traditional brick-and-mortar model to a more contemporary, digitally empowered business. Leveraging advanced technologies, including an e-commerce platform and Industry 4.0 tools, Indoors Furniture can be best in class by introducing free, personalized online services that further enhance value for its customers and hence outshine in one aspect of IKEA's value proposition in India. The ADKAR model will be able to institutionalize successful change management for workforce transition and operations at the company. It will also ensure long-term growth, customer satisfaction, and competitive advantage of the entity in the market.
