"Why did the furniture company embrace digital transformation? Because it realized it was time to *rearrange* its strategy!"

Your analysis of Indoors Furniture is comprehensive, especially your detailed breakdown of the current value chain and how it can be transformed. The proposal to integrate e-commerce and IoT-based operations is excellent and well-targeted to address the companyâ€™s current limitations. The comparison with IKEA also adds a nice layer of context, highlighting the competitive advantage Indoors Furniture can gain through personalization.
