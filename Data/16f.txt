"Trader Joe’s with AI and robotics—soon robots will be stocking shelves while AI picks out the perfect avocado! Let’s just hope the tech stacks up as well as their snacks!"

Now for the feedback:

Well-structured: You’ve clearly identified the key areas in the value chain where technology can improve efficiency. The focus on AI-driven supplier management, robotics for stocking, and AR/VR technologies is well thought out and relevant for modernizing retail.
To improve: Including specific examples of other companies successfully using these technologies (like AI for inventory management or robotics in retail) would strengthen your proposal and provide a clearer picture of real-world applications. Keep up the good work!
