**Professor's Feedback:**

*"Blockchain in supply chains—sounds like the food is fresher, but I hope it doesn't mean we’re getting 'cryptoveggies'!"*

Now for the feedback:

- **Good real-world examples**: I like how you brought in Walmart and the diamond industry. It really grounds your points.
- **Suggestion**: Try to connect your challenges section more directly to your examples. How do the high costs and legal issues affect Walmart’s blockchain use, for instance? It would make your analysis stronger.
