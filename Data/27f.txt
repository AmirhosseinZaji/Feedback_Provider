"RetroWoods going digital? Well, it looks like even old-school furniture is getting a tech upgrade—next thing you know, the chairs will be ordering themselves!"

Your detailed breakdown of RetroWoods' current situation was clear, and the focus on operational inefficiencies was well presented. The proposed solutions, especially the use of AI and a smart POS system, show a solid understanding of digital transformation.

One area for improvement: your proposed value chain could benefit from more specificity in certain areas, like how exactly the AI-based website and app will integrate with the existing systems. Also, the potential resistance from employees is a great point, but expanding on how Kotter’s model will help mitigate these concerns would strengthen your argument.

Great job overall! You're moving RetroWoods into the future in style.
